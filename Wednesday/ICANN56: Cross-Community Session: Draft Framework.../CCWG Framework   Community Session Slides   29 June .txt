Community Session – Developing a Final
Framework of Uniform Principles for Cross
Community Working Groups
ICANN56 | 29 June 2016

Goals of this Cross Community Session
• To discuss topics identified by the community as major
concerns in public comments to the Draft Framework
Purpose

• To obtain the community’s input as the Working Group
begins to finalize the Final Framework
• Aim is for Final Framework to be adopted by Chartering
Organizations before ICANN57 (in time for upcoming
anticipated CCWG on New gTLD Auction Proceeds)
• Topics:

Scope

•

Ensuring diversity in membership and representativeness

•

Planning for budgeting and other resource allocations
(exception rather than the norm for CCWGs)

•

Defining consensus

•

Role of CCWG in implementing recommendations

•

[if time permits] Board approval of CCWG recommendations

Introduction to the proposed final
Framework of Uniform Principles

What has been completed and what are the next steps?

About this CCWG

What the Framework covers

• Co-chartered by the
ccNSO & GNSO Councils
• More CCWGs are being
used but with no uniform,
commonly-agreed
principles on their
formation or operations
• Draft Framework published
for public comments in
February 2016
• Framework is a set of
recommended guidelines,
not rigid rules (though
some elements are
strongly recommended)

• Certain questions to answer before initiating a
CCWG
• Adoption of a single Charter
• CCWG outputs to be based on CCWG consensus
• A CCWG does not replace policy development
mechanisms

Next steps
• CCWG will review ICANN56 community feedback
and prepare final version of Final Framework
• Submit to ccNSO & GNSO Councils for adoption;
send to all other SO/ACs – before ICANN57
• If adopted, apply to all future CCWGs

Community discussion on the topics identified
as of major concern

1. What should the Framework recommend for diversity of membership and
representativeness in future CCWGs?
• Draft Framework did not contain a specific recommendation
• Proposed Final Framework retains SO/AC autonomy for appointing members
o Adds recommendation that they should “consult with one another to ensure that there
is diversity of representation to the extent feasible – including but not limited to
geographical region, stakeholder group and relevant skill sets”
o Board/staff liaison roles to be included in a CCWG Charter, as needed

• CCWG considered but decided it would be impractical to have a full list of what
might constitute diversity
• Some public comments suggested additional diversity categories and collecting
data to measure effectiveness
QUESTION FOR THE COMMUNITY:
Does the CCWG’s proposed language address the concerns in a sufficiently
pragmatic and inclusive way?

2. How should issues relating to additional budgeting and resources be handled?
• Draft Framework did not contain a specific recommendation
• Proposed Final Framework suggests that:
o From experience, most CCWGs will not require additional budget/staff support over and
above what is normally provided to working groups (i.e. CWG-Stewardship & CCWGAccountability are exceptions rather than the norm)
o The need for any additional budget or other resources must be raised as early as
possible (e.g. in pre-chartering initiation phase when SO/ACs are discussing the need
for a CCWG) and further described in the Charter
o Such budget requests should be handled as far as possible through ICANN’s usual
annual budget cycle

QUESTION FOR THE COMMUNITY:
Does the CCWG’s proposed approach suffice as a guideline for future CCWGs?

3A. Is there a need to change the suggested definition/methodology for determining
consensus?
• Draft Framework contained the following specific recommendation:
o Full Consensus - no minority disagrees; identified by an absence of objection
o Consensus –a small minority disagrees, but most agree
o In the absence of Full Consensus, minority viewpoint(s), if any, may be submitted
o If Chair(s) cannot designate any consensus, Chartering Organizations to be informed in
order to take mitigating measures (to include closing the CCWG)

• Some public comments suggested more detail on deriving consensus, including
guidance on who is involved in consensus calls (e.g. members vs participants)
• Some public comments were concerned at the ability of a group to “stack” a
CCWG, or a single SO/AC to block consensus outputs by objecting to them
• CCWG believes most concerns addressed by other recommendations and does
not propose changes to its definition or guidance on internal CCWG consensus
QUESTION FOR THE COMMUNITY:
Does the CCWG’s proposed approach suffice as a guideline for future CCWGs?

3B. A note on the role of the Chartering Organizations vis-à-vis a CCWG’s output
• Both the Draft and Final Frameworks distinguish between who “holds the pen” on
the content of CCWG output – this is the CCWG
• If a Chartering Organization objects to or has concerns about proposed CCWG
output, it must send the report back to the CCWG for its consideration
• CCWG output/recommendations are deemed final only if all Chartering
Organizations adopt/approve/support/do not object
• Draft and Final Frameworks also propose that Chartering Organizations have the
authority to close a CCWG:
o If Chartering Organizations cannot agree to support the recommendations; OR
o If the CCWG Chair(s) report that the CCWG itself cannot reach consensus

4. Should a CCWG have a role in implementing its recommendations, if adopted?
• Draft Framework acknowledges this to be the area where community has the least
experience to draw from
• Proposed Final Framework adds further details to facilitate future CCWG work:
o If applicable, in formulating its recommendations, a CCWG should refer to and
incorporate the Policy & Implementation Guidelines developed by the GNSO in 2015
o If a CCWG believes it is necessary to be involved in implementation, this must be
spelled out in its deliverables to its Chartering Organizations
o If the COs agree, they should specify a timeline and task list for the CCWG during
implementation, as far as possible

QUESTION FOR THE COMMUNITY:
Does the CCWG’s additional recommendations suffice as a guideline for future
CCWGs?

5. Other Topics of Community Interest
(i) Role of the Board in approving CCWG recommendations
• Proposed Final Framework recommends this be clarified during the
Charter drafting phase
• Charter to specify that Board consideration needed if anticipated
outcomes will:
o impact SO policy development processes;
o require implementation by ICANN (e.g. similar to implementing GNSO
policy);
o result in possible Bylaw changes); or
o otherwise trigger action by the Board, the Charter and the CCWG’s Final
Report should make clear that the final recommendations will require Board
consideration
•

If so, Charter may also need to specify appropriate role for the Board during the
CCWG’s work phase

(ii) Other topics of interest?
