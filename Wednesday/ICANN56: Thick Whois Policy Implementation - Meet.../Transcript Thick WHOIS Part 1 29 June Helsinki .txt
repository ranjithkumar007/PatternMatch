Okay, it's 12:31 per my clock. And we're to start at 12:30, correct? Okay.
Okay, thank you. Welcome, everyone. This is the Thick Whois Policy
Implementation IRT Meeting on June 29, 2016 at ICANN 56 in Helsinki.
Welcome. My name is Dennis Chang. I am GDD Services & Engagement
Program Director, and I'll be moderating this session today.
So before we get started, I would like to go around the table and introduce
ourselves. There's not too many of us. So if you're in the back, please feel
free to come and join us at the table, because you will need to use the
microphone if you're going to ask questions or comment, for the people who
are remotely participating. So please come up and let's fill out this table.
So we'll start with introductions. So let's start from Kristine. Go ahead and
introduce yourself and your role. And if you're an IRT member, please identify

Dennis Chang:

Okay. I understand Mark Anderson is there, too. Thank you for checking in.
All right then, let's get started. So let me cover the agenda, and a couple of
the preceding slides. And Fabien is going to go ahead and take over, as he
usually does on the IRT meetings.
So for this session, we'll do some background and talk about the milestones
and recent activities. And we will be looking at policy implementation timeline,
and the consistent labeling and display that is the next step. And what we
would like to do is focus today's session on the transition from thin to thick.
So we want to remind you of the current objectives, and we'll go from there.
Now we have two sessions at this ICANN 56 in Helsinki. So we have this
session, and then tomorrow we will have another session. So think of it as a
continuation of the IRT work. And what I'd like to do is, today we'll do the
background, and we'll answer questions in an overview fashion if you have
any questions about the program. And we'll cover our general approach to
the implementation.
And if we have - if at all possible, what we would like to do is really get to the
working session of the timeline, and perhaps get a consensus of that timeline;
and tomorrow maybe look over the whole timeline, and then the rest of the
plan.
So let's see. Some background. I think most of the IRT members know this.
The Thick Whois Policy Development was done in March 2012 to October
2013. And the Board adopted the recommendation in February 2014.
And there's two expected outcomes of the policy recommendation. One is the
consistent labeling and display, and the other is the transition from thin to
thick for .com, .net and .jobs. So we'll be talking about the two different
expected outcomes or tracks, however you want to think about it. But it was
the IRT's decision to go about this as two separate projects, and we'll

ICANN

Page 4

probably end up making the implementation, you know, two different
timelines, too.
So this is basically some details on the steps that we have taken, and some
of the milestones that we have achieved, starting in November '14, 2014. And
I won't go over the details here. These slides will be posted on the session
calendar, so you can look them up later.
So let's look at our policy implementation timeline. It's a busy slide, and it'll
take some time to get used to. The IRT members have seen this several
times before, but there are new participants, so I would like to take a little bit
of more time and talk about this. Fabien, do you want to take over from here?
Fabien Betremieux:

Sure. Thank you, Dennis. So what you see on this slide - so hello,

everyone. Sorry. I apologize for not being with you, and I hope that we can
learn these slides this way in an effective way.
So what you see on this slide is the implementation timeline, so that is the
policy implementation work we're doing. So let's start at the bottom of the
slide. So that piece is the transition from thin to thick. As you understand,
we've coupled our work in those two areas, the transition for the
(unintelligible) and the consistent labeling and display way for all gTLDs.
If you look at the bottom part, as you can see we're still working through the
design of the implementation plan, which we aim to publish for public
comment in the fall, from September to October roughly, with the idea that by
the end of the year, we would have a revised plan for input we'd received in
the public comments, and announce the policy effective date, on that basis,
early next year. So that's for the transition from thin to thick on .com, .net and
.jobs.

For the second outcome, in the middle of the slide, that's thick Whois
consistent labeling and display, as you may be aware, we have published a
proposed policy language for public comment in December.
That public comment period ended in March. And we are now working
through revising this policy language based on the input we received, and we
intend to announce the policy effective date later this month - I mean in July,
end of July. And so we'll talk about the status and next steps of that piece in a
minute.
And we have on this slide the bottom part, which is the (unintelligible)
timeline, because as you may be aware, we are synchronizing the
implementation of consistent labeling and display of the Whois output for all
gTLDs. And we have the rollout of the (unintelligible) profile.
So this is why you can see that goes through - are synchronized. This was
one of the objectives of our implementation, to minimize impact on affected
parties. Dennis, let me stop here and see if there's any questions or
comments at this point.
Dennis Chang:

Anyone have questions? I don't see any hands raised in the room or in the
Adobe Connect, so let's proceed.

Fabien Betremieux:

Thank you. So let me move on to the next slide. So let's talk about

consistent labeling and display, and provide some status there, and an
indication of next steps.
So as you can see the first bullet, that's a reminder of what was the text of the
actual PDP working group Recommendation Number 1, from which stemmed
those two outcomes we've talked about, consistent labeling and display of
Whois output for all gTLDs, and the transition from thin to thick for .com, .net
and .jobs.

ICANN

So we're talking here about this specific outcome of the consistent labeling
and display of Whois output for all gTLDs. We've heard - we've received
substantial comments on our initial proposal. And so we've made a series of
revisions which we've discussed.
We've actually considered the comments we've received. We've discussed
those comments with the IRT, and now we will release later today our revised
proposed policy language which incorporates those three elements here in
the middle of this slide.
We've heard that there were substantial concerns with the potential confusion
of displaying the registry expiration date and the registrar expiration date in
the same Whois output. So we have decided that the display of the registrar
expiration date, as well as the reselling permission, will be optional. And there
will be no suggestions of mitigation mechanisms for those that would like to
display those two expiration dates. So that's the first element.
The second one, we've received succinct feedback around the notion that
making a reference to Section 3 of the 2013 RAA in our policy would cause a
problem for registries, because of consensus policies becoming requirements
of the registries, there would be a linkage between the RA and the RAA that
was problematic for registries.
So what we are doing is that we will remove such a reference, and replace it
by a specification, detailed specification, of the changes that would be
applicable to registries (unintelligible).
And finally, there were also some concerned - concerns, sorry, with the
reference to the Whois clarification advisory in our draft policy, because it
was perceived as making this advisory a contractual requirement, which was
not the intent. So we have made specific reference to this being a
complement, not an element constituting the policy.

And so as I mentioned, as far as next steps, we will share the language later
today for review by the IRT. And hopefully this will fit what the IRT was
expecting, and is in line with the comments we received, and we will move on
to publish that policy language at the end of the month of July for
implementation by affected parties by February 1, 2017. Let me stop here,
Dennis, and see if there's any questions or comments.
Dennis Chang:

Go ahead, Joe.

Joe Waldron:

Yeah, Joe Waldron from Verisign. So thanks for the update, Fabien. I think
that's helpful. I know there was a lot of discussion about the reseller and
registrar expiration date, so I think that it might be helpful just to have a brief
discussion about what that really means.
So my understanding of that is that that's optional. Since these are - these
apply to all gTLDs, right? So this is optional at the registry operator level. So
is that a correct understanding?

Fabien Betremieux:

That's correct, Joe. Thank you. Because the policy does apply to

(unintelligible).
Joe Waldron:

Thank you.

Dennis Chang:

Go ahead, Jordan.

Jordan Buchanan: Thanks. Just a brief comment. I'd like to thank the staff for their
responsiveness to the feedback you received. I think this roughly - this
reflects certainly the feedback that Google provided in our most recent
comment on this. And I think it's a much better solution than the previously
one proposed. So I just wanted to thank the staff for its reactivity, and this
implementation looks right to me based on my understanding of the policy.

Dennis Chang:

We appreciate that. Thank you for that comment. No other comment. So as
Fabien said, this is important for the IRT members. Please check your email
today, tonight, because you will receive a document. And hopefully you can
have a chance to look at it. And in our tomorrow's session, we can talk about
this again, if you like. Move on, Fabien.

Fabien Betremieux:

Let me mention on this subject one thing. The format of the language will

be different than what we have drafted and submitted for public comment.
This is why we really need the IRT's attention. We believe the substance is
no different. It's actually what we've explained here in line with the feedback
we've received.
But because we've changed the format of the way we've written the policy,
this needs the attention of the IRT, and we can certainly take time tomorrow
to walk everyone through it and discuss it.
And one of the main changes in terms of format is that we have gone into
more of the details, because as I mentioned, we specified the changes that
would apply to registries' RDDS output, as opposed to making a reference
(unintelligible). And we hope that by doing this, we've made a very clear
policy language that will be helpful for everyone to implement.
Okay. So, Dennis, unless there's any question or comments, I'm moving on to
the next slide.
Dennis Chang:

Please do.

Fabien Betremieux:

So now on to the transition from thin to thick. Here is a reminder of what

we're trying to do, and what we've been doing for the past six months at least,
in particular.
We've identified that there should be two parallel tracks in the implementation
of the transition -- a track for the handling of the new registrations, and a track

ICANN
Moderator: Nathalie Peregrine
06-29-16/4:03 am CT
Confirmation # 8995675
Page 9

for the handling of existing registrations. I'm not going to speak to the
implementation plan. We've discussed this already. Our target is to publish
this in January 2017.
In order to get there, we've agreed with the IRT that we will - we have been
working - discussing an implementation path that we're trying to close this
week. And on that basis, we would then, as staff, draft an implementation
proposal by the end of the month of July, which would then be reviewed and
validated by the IRT before going for public comment.
So we are at this stage today where we're trying to close the discussion of
the implementation path, and switch to a mode where we can draft a plan that
would then become what we submit to the community, and eventually publish
for implementation.
So where are we today on the discussion of the implementation path? As of
last week, the high level agreement that there is right now in the IRT is the
following. And please, IRT members, stop me if you don't recognize the
consensus here.
First, we would approach the transition, as I mentioned, in two tracks that
would have potentially independent timelines. And I think the assumption was
discussed as to ensure that any delay or complication in one track would not
affect the other one. That's the first principle.
The second one is that with respect to existing registration data, the registry
system would enforce a limited set of validation rules, and this would be to
ensure that all the existing registration data is transitioned, and there's no
data left out because of data formatting or data missing issues; the objective
being that after the transition, the registries' RDDS output should contain as
much information as was available in both the registry and the registrar's
RDDS output before the transition.

ICANN
Moderator: Nathalie Peregrine

Page 10

And so in concrete terms, there will be three specific fields that would be
required for contact, and that's the contact ID, postal info type, and
(unintelligible). That's a bit of the details of the discussion right now.
I believe it's important to note this principle, that we are aiming for the same
amount of information before and after the transition, but making sure that all
the transition - all the data can indeed transition. So that was the second
principle.
The third one is that there would be two options available to registrars for
completing the transition of existing registration data. There would be an EPP
channel and a file-based channel. There are still some elements in defining
both of those channels, but I think the IRT agrees on these two channels.
And finally, the fourth principle, and that speaks to the validation rules
enforced by the registry systems. And the idea is that once existing
registration data is transitioned, the transition is complete, or that the date for
that transition has passed, then it's regular validation rules that would apply.
So the same rules would apply for new registration and existing registration
after that cut-off date of the transition of existing registration from thin to thick.
Let me stop here, Dennis, and see if there is any question or comments.
Theo Geurts:

Good morning, good afternoon, everybody. This is Theo from (unintelligible)
register. Just about to highlight something regarding Point 2 there, regarding
the EPP. The IRT hasn't been able to actually come to a sort of consensus
there on what EPP we are going to use in the terms of like - let me explain it
a little bit.
Currently Verisign has two EPP channels -- its so-called back channel, the
back pool channel, and there is the shared registration system that they offer.
And most registrars - well I don't likely know if most registrars use the SRS

ICANN
Moderator: Nathalie Peregrine

Confirmation # 8995675
Page 11

pool or the batch pool. So we still need to figure out where we are going to
connect to, or if both will become available. Thanks.
Fabien Betremieux:

Yes, thank you to you. And we - you know, depending on the time we

have today and certainly tomorrow, we can spend more time and go back into
those open items we have, and try to close as much as we can - as many of
them as we can.
((Crosstalk))
Dennis Chang:

We have a comment from Joe.

Joe Waldron:

Yeah, thanks. This is Joe Waldron from Verisign. So just on that point, so the
two bullets - just for clarification. The two bullets here is EPP which will be a
transactional mechanism for registrars to be able to upload all of that data, as
they do for any other transactions.
The bulk file is one that I believe has been discussed quite a bit, but I'm not
sure that we have any kind of consensus from the registrars on preference of
having a bulk upload capability versus EPP. So I think that's still an open
issue, but those are the two that have been discussed within the group.
And then to the point about which of the EPP channels - I guess I don't look
at them as different channels. But you're right. We have a standard pool of
connections, and then we also have a batch pool that are typically used by
registrars that are picking up deleting names.
So those are available to the registrars, and I think that's an implementation
detail that we can get to, but I don't think it's necessarily, you know, relevant
to how we're going to do it, I think. The main question at this point is, do
registrars want to individually upload the data, or do that through bulk files?

Jordan Buchanan: It's Jordan Buchanan with Google. This is a quick question based on reading
this. If the notion of sort of doing new registrations and transitioning the prior
registrations are happening in parallel, I'm trying to wrap my head a little bit
around the validation rules.
Are we saying that during the transition period, new registrations will be
subject to the normal validation rules, while contact objects that are
associated with older domains will have lighter validation rules? Or is the
validation rules across the entire system going to be lighter-weight during the
transition period?
Joe Waldron:

It's Joe. So I think we've circulated a document that has what validation is
done. And I would say it's a fairly lightweight validation. This is not intended
to satisfy the Whois accuracy requirements. Registrars do that. So the
validation rules should be the same for both sets of data.

Jordan Buchanan: Like, I guess, what's the point of this last bullet on this slide there? What's the
difference between post-transition and during transition, in terms of validation
rules?
Joe Waldron:

I guess the way I was reading that was that if you - once you backfill the data,
then any modifications to that data just follow the normal validation rules that
are in place. Maybe I'm not reading it the way it was intended. So, Fabienâ€¦

Fabien Betremieux:
Dennis Chang:

No, that's right. That's right.

Go ahead, Fabien.

Fabien Betremieux:

Yeah, no, I was going to say, Joe, this is correct. I think once the

registration data - the existing registrations are transitioned, then those are
subject to the same validation as the new registrations. But during the
transition, Joe, I think, to clarify and make sure, the current discussion has

ICANN
Moderator: Nathalie Peregrine
06-29-16/4:03 am CT
Confirmation # 8995675
Page 13

been that the validation rules that are enforced on both of these types of data,
new and existing registrations, are different in parallel.
So each are operating in their own track. New registrations are subject to the
full registry system validation rules, or to a given set of rules. And the existing
registrations are subject to another set of rules where mandatory fields are
different. Is that consistent with your understanding, Joe?
Joe Waldron:

This is Joe. So I'll have to go back and look at that. I don't - I guess I wasn't
following that.

Fabien Betremieux:
Joe Waldron:

Yeah, I'm trying toâ€¦

There may be different - I was just going to say there may be different
validation if you're doing bulk files. I can see that you'd have different
validation of the files. But I think that if you're doing EPP transactions, they'd
be the same. But I'll go back and double-check that.

Fabien Betremieux:

Yeah, I'm trying to get (unintelligible) the IRT to show - so let me see. I

have the documents here. I'm going to - just give me one minute. I'm going to
load it in the (unintelligible).
Dennis Chang:

So while you do that, Fabien, Mark Anderson, go ahead.

Mark Anderson:

Hi, this is Mark Anderson. Can you hear me okay?

Dennis Chang:

We hear you fine.

Mark Anderson:

Great. Just on that point, during the transition period, the reduced validation
rules would apply to both new registrations and for the backfill of existing
legacy registrations.

ICANN
Moderator: Nathalie Peregrine
06-29-16/4:03 am CT
Confirmation # 8995675
Page 14

From a system perspective, we just wouldn't have a way of differentiating
between the two. There's no practical way that we could differentiate the
intent of registrars if it's a new registration or an existing registration. So, you
know, those reduced validation rules that Fabien's pulling up right now would
apply to both during this transition period. Thank you.
Fabien Betremieux:

Thank you, Mark. I think that's a useful clarification, because I don't

believe we had (unintelligible) discussed this point, or maybe it was missed in
our notes, in the scorecard.
But so I guess then we need to make sure that that's well-understood from
everybody on the IRT, that the minimum validation rules we talked about,
which are reflected in the reference here, would then apply, as you just
mentioned, to the new registrations and the existing registrations during the
period of transitioning existing registrations.
So let me stop here and see if any other IRT members have comments on
this subject.
Dennis Chang:

Go ahead.

Christian Muller: Christian Muller from STRATO, Berlin, Germany. We have a quite large
number of .com domains would probably transfer (unintelligible) transfer.
What do we do if systematically our data is - you know, has some
shortcomings due to the new needs here? I mean when do we fix that? And
how do we call 800,000 customers? Or how is that supposed to work?
Dennis Chang:

You want to address that, Theo?

Theo Geurts:

Yeah. Let me try to address it for Christian. So we are going for these relaxed
validation rules because the IRT thinks, assumes, there is missing data. I
mean we're talking about really old data here. So that's why we have some
relaxed rules here.

ICANN
Moderator: Nathalie Peregrine

Page 15

So the idea is just to transfer the data that you have. If you are missing
certain fields here, there is nothing going to happen. We think that over time,
the missing fields or missing data will correct itself organically, so to speak. At
least that's our thinking.
Regardless, or nevertheless, your requirements with ICANN compliance
regarding the RAA 2013 Whois specification will remain in place. So every
time you get a complaint, you will have to fix it. And this is sort of like the
organic process that we are thinking that data will correct itself.
What we don't want to do is, in advance, to have like a massive data
correction program started. I mean it will delay the Whois migration till
forever, I think. So that's why we came up with this idea. Thank you.
Jordan Buchanan: Hi. This is Jordan Buchanan again. So just to make sure I understand so in
the post transition state then you'll be having sort of standard enforcement
like other gTLD registries do. Does that mean that you can't associate a
contact object with limited data with the new registration or does that just
mean you can't update - create a contact object or update an object in a way
that's invalid? Roger's saying it's the latter, not the former.
Roger Carney:

Yes that's right. And just to clarify for the transition there's only three required
fields and it's, you know, basic cost code. I did the IDs and everything. So the
data, everybody knows there's a lot of data that's not correct. But posttransition I think there's like 13 or 17 required fields that have to be formatted
correctly -- things like that. So the data that gets put into the SRS until
updated is going to be what it was. So on update on create after the transition
the new rules would apply.

Jordan Buchanan: Right but on create you could still create a domain name and associate it with
a sort of old school contact object?

Correct on a contact create or contract.

Jordan Buchanan: Okay great.
(Jenis):

Go ahead. That's okay. I mean I was looking for that. I was hoping from that
not that we think that we have really weird (unintelligible) missing data. But
this time he thinks like the international format of the phone number is not
correct or stuff, you know.

Man:

Very good. And go ahead.

Jeff Eckhaus:

Jeff Eckhaus here. So I think first I want to say I know when I - when we first
saw this information in this deck I'd say most of the team was very happy to
actually have something in place. So I want to say thanks to the team for that.
I'm just reading some of the notes from some of the teams because some of
the members are - who are not here are - were either observers or members.
I think one of the questions they had is for somebody like us we have millions
and millions of contacts that'll need to be created.
What is - I haven't seen on something here and maybe it's - I don't want to
steal your thunder. It's one of the next slides, but what's the timeline for this?
You know, I know you said you'd be announcing the date but what's sort of
the span you expect this to happen because it's not going to be an overnight
process?

(Jenis):

You are correct. So the timeline slide is coming up and that is what we're
wanting to focus this session on so you're right on stop. Any other questions
before we get there?

Roger Carney:

It's Roger again. Just on the last bullet here I think we need to be a little more
clear because I mean I think Jordan actually brought up this question here as
what happens with those sayings? And I - the team never really came to a
conclusion on what happens to transfers either because transfers we still

ICANN
Moderator: Nathalie Peregrine
06-29-16/4:03 am CT
Confirmation # 8995675
Page 17

have to create new contact ROIDs because they're registrar based. But we're
going to have old data from a different registrar. So we never did as a team
agree on what was going to happen with those contacts and what validation
would apply to those going forward as well soâ€¦
(Jenis):

Fabien go ahead.

Fabien Betremieux:

Yes thank you Roger. That's right, I think this is one of the remaining of

good items that we need to discuss. So, you know, I think we should also add
a discussion of the case that Jordan just highlighted as well. Okay so we can
probably now move on to discussing the timeline. So let me share - is this
readable or not because I've prepared a slide with bigger fonts? Do you
prefer that I switch or is it good enough?
(Jenis):

I think it's good enough. We have a really big screen here.

Fabien Betremieux:

Okay good, good. So with - so the IRT has discussed timelines on several

occasions. And so we've tried to represent here what we understand would
be the - it's - I don't know how that was. Okay.
So we tried to represent here what is our understanding of the discussions
and the shortest path possible for implementing this transition from thin to
thick. So as you can see on this slide we divided the slide in two parts with
transition new registration and the transitional (unintelligible) registration. So
let me speak to the first part.
So we're starting from our current you assumed announcement of policy
sector base. And that - so that's end of January 2017. We understand that
regarding new registration registries will need to update their systems and
announce those changes for registrars so that we've - we understand that
this would be - there were a three months' timeline discussed in the IRT. But
so if we're adding registries needed to - you know, timing for registries to
update their system so we're at six months here at a point at which optional

thick would be available in a registry production system. So any registrars
wanting to start transition their new registration would be able to do so then.
And the registrars that the line in orange here we have had six months to
prepare for doing that and would have six months after that date to complete
their transition of a new registration to pick. And at the end of that 12 months
for registrars we would prepare and complete the process. Thick Whois
would be required in the production systems of the registries at which time
would be the actual policy effective date for new registration. So this is for the
transition of new registration.
Regarding the existing registrations we've assumed the same amount of time
for registries to prepare and announce changes. And the IRT has discussed
in this area a need for at least 18 months to complete the transition of existing
registration from thin to thick. And so that's why the minimum time here would
be 18 months as for the IRT discussion so far at which time it would be the
policy effective date for existing registration.
So I understand that the conversation we just had on the relationship
between validation rules for existing registrations and new registrations
during a transition might effect this timeline. But let me stop here and see
what IRT members think of this representation. I think we're trying to
understand whether this is a fair representation of the discussion so far.
(Joe Alber):

Yes, this is (Joe Alber) from Verisign. So I know in the past we talked quite a
bit about the legal analysis that was required as part of the task to the IRT.
And ICANN delivered that and I know that many of us have reviewed that.
But I think that, you know, even the RDS Working Group session that (Chuck)
chaired yesterday brought up a number of issues that I think impact some of
the considerations that we have to look at for both. We - and we were talking
about this primarily from a backfill perspective of some of these old
registrations that have been around for many, many years and the impact to
registrants that had signed registration agreements under one set of

ICANN
Moderator: Nathalie Peregrine

Confirmation # 8995675
Page 19

conditions. So that's a distinction that we had drawn previously between new
registrations and previously registered names.
But as we were going through both the legal analysis some of the discussions
that were going on yesterday in the RDS Working Group session there was a
lot of discussion about jurisdictional issues. And I know that I think many of us
are familiar with the EU privacy law changes. There was a comment made
yesterday about some countries not allowing private PII to leave their country.
So this I think does create a situation that we need to look at and understand,
you know, what that impact is. And that impact really both registries and
registrars and not just Verisign in the operation of COMNET or employ media
for .jobs. But I think it's a broader question about privacy data. And that was a
specific call out in the task to the IRT was if there were privacy issues that
weren't addressed in the working group that came to light as a part of this
work that we should, you know, provide that notification back to the GNSO.
So I think that that's another area that we ought to consider because I don't
know if waivers are going to be sufficient. I know Fabien at one point had
talked about, you know, potentially having a system where we had, you know,
where waivers became the rule and not the standard right? And we know
some registries have received waives. But as some of these countries I think
Russia has a privacy law going into effect on September 1 that requires PII to
remain in Russia. At least that's not my non-legal read of what I've - I
understand. So I think that some of these issues are just raising that question
of is this the time now to go back to the GNSO and propose that as an issue
that is outside of the mandate or the scope for the people that we have
assemble for the IRT?
Krista Papac:

Thanks (Joe), Krista Papac, ICANN staff. Wait so just a reminder first of all of
all what the recommendation on this particular requirement was. I think it was
Recommendation 2. I was trying to find them but I've over-organized myself.
It was three, okay.

ICANN
Moderator: Nathalie Peregrine

But the - it's - the recommendation was for the legal review to look at whether
there were other privacy concerns that the EWG did not identify and that
there were that the IRT would go back to the GNSO. So that's the first thing.
And then to your point it is correct that the IRT could go back to the GNSO if
they did identify concerns that - excuse me, privacy issues, if the legal review
did find that there were privacy issues that were not already identified by the
Expert Working Group.
The review did say that it didn't find any additional, you know, so the same
set of privacy issues that we've been aware of from since the BWG work. But
it is - it's your IRT so, you know, you guys can certainly discuss that. And I
know that we even mentioned the - asked the IRT about this specifically
based on some comments you made (Joe) at what meeting was it? I think it
was maybe two meetings ago?
(Joe Alber):

It was in Dublin.

Krista Papac:

Dublin at the end of that meeting. So we have an IRT call following the Dublin
meeting where we said, "This is kind of still an open item. You know, is this
something that should go back to the GNSO or not, IRT?" And you guys
came back and said, "No, we think we should proceed." So if there's going to
be a different decision made or a different discussion that's one thing that just
may be a little bit of a reminder or what we've been, you know, discussed so
far and what the recommendations say and what the legal review said.

(Joe Alber):

Thanks and good memory, something memorable I guess.

Krista Papac:

That's right.

(Joe Alber):

So I've got the language here so I'll read it because I think that I'm not trying
to make more of this than it needs to be but I think it's important. So it does
refer to the applicable really to the transition of from a thin to thick model that

ICANN
Moderator: Nathalie Peregrine
06-29-16/4:03 am CT
Confirmation # 8995675
Page 21

has not already been considered by the EWG memo undertaken with due
consideration and I'm going to skip to the what has to happen.
So should any privacy issues emerge from the transition discussion that were
not anticipated by the working group so in this case the working group I
assumed, not the EWG but the PDP working group. So maybe that's my
interpretation which would review - which would require additional policy
consideration the Implementation Review Team's expected to notify the
GNSO council of these so that appropriate actions could be taken. So that's
all I'm saying is I think that we have learned things and we have had changes
that potentially impact registries and registrars across the board in terms of,
you know, laws that are changing, you know, with the EU privacy laws, other
countries that have these - have implemented or now going to be enforcing
these data restrictions.
And I think that we have an obligation to raise these and refer these - at least
notify the GNSO of these issues because I think that if we're going to build a
system where registrars and registries have more exceptions than the rule
then we've - then we're perhaps building the wrong system right? We're
implementing this in a way that isn't sustainable or maintainable. And that's all - that's what I really want to make sure that, you know, that we comply with
that task which is if we've identified privacy issues that haven't been
considered in that working group that we notify the GNSO.
(Jenis):

Any comments on this from other members of the IRT? Go ahead.

Theo Geurts:

Okay this is Theo for the record. Those are pretty serious concerns you have,
the IGO and I shared them with you. Currently what we did as an IRT
because there are so many countries who have some kind of data privacy
law in their country and maybe not as strict as the EU but nevertheless there
are like 110 countries out there that have something in place there. We as the
IRT sort of figured like this is not our problem. It's not within scope for us at
the moment because we can't actually handle that at the IRT. We donâ€™t have

ICANN

Page 22

enough people, we don't have the expertise. So we could bring up here right
now I think that's worth discussion.
(Jenis):

Any further discussion on this? Go ahead (Joe)?

(Joe Alber):

Yes so I would just say that I would recommend that we comply with that
statement and provide that notification to the GNSO to raise our, you know,
the points about the changes or the privacy issues that - even the ICANN
memo deferred many of these decisions to registries and registrars to
conduct their own analysis. So we've been conducting our analysis and I
think that, you know, there's a question of when a registrar passes personal
data to us as the registry in the United States are they able to do that in a
lawful way? Are we lawfully receiving and storing and displaying that data in
Whois? And I think that's an open question for us and I think that that's again
being discussed in a number of other venues right now but I think that we
have an obligation to provide that notification back to the GNSO so that would
be my recommendation.

Krista Papac:

Thanks (Joe), Krista Papac again. So how - what's the best way to proceed
with doing that? Do you guys want us - like would you want to draft
something or how would you propose moving like making that happen?

(Joe Alber):

To be honest I don't mind drafting something. I don't know that it's - I don't
know that anything has ever been referred back to the GNSO. We may be
breaking new ground here. So maybe that's what we need to think of
overnight and we'll, you know, we'll talk to our folks and we can - maybe
that's something we can discuss in tomorrow's session.

Krista Papac:

That's a great suggestion by the way. And I'm so glad we have two sessions
this week. And just and thank you for reading the recommendation. I did - I
mean I assigned it to you and what the direction is is expected to notify the
GNSO of these so that appropriate actions can be taken. So anyway but just
to kind of refresh everybody of what the - what you just read a few minutes

ICANN

ago and while we think on it overnight and maybe take this up again
tomorrow figure out. Iâ€™m not sure if this isn't done either so we'll get creative.
Thank you.
Alex Deacon:

Hi. Alex Deacon with the MPAA. I'm just curious if we do refer this back to the
GNSO what's the impact? Do things continue in parallel or do we have to wait
for a response from GNSO to continue?

Krista Papac:

That's for the question. This is Krista again. It's sort of why I wanted to reread
this. It says to notify the GNSO rather than refer back. I think that's an
important distinction. So my thinking is because it says notify that we would
continue our work here but still send that notification. And then it goes on to
say so that appropriate action can be taken by the GNSO. So that - I see
everybody else nodding their head so I think we have agreement there.
Thank you.

(Jenis):

So that being said I'd like to bring your attention back to the schedule that
we're looking at here. And notification being done in parallel to our activity.
What does the IRT think about this schedule making the distinction between
the new registration and existing registration first, right? Is this the right
approach to take? Is this still rule from the registrar side as well as the
registry side?
We've been listening to the comments along the way in the previous
meetings and we believe that this facilitates everyone's need or can we do
better than this? Would you like to accelerate some parts of this to make this
faster? Let me hear from you. Go ahead Jody.

Jody Kolker:

Hi this is Jody from GoDaddy. Can you hear me?

(Jenis):

Loud and clear.

Jody Kolker:

Hi. My concerns are on the time table as long as you're asking. Is 18 months
a timeline for the existing registration? I - we have a significant amount of
domains at GoDaddy so 18 months what I was hoping for was to have 18
months from the time that the registry has prepared, has offered the ECP to
be updated so that we can start sending (unintelligible) registrations. So if the
registry wasn't ready until six months into that timeline that would only give us
12 months to complete the existing registration. I was hoping to get 18
months from the time that the registry was ready.

Jeff Eckhaus:

It's Jeff Eckhaus here from Rightside and we're probably second behind Jody
and GoDaddy in having to do this. And I'd like to echo his comments saying
that I also thought it was also from once it was available to begin uploading
then it would start the 18 month period. So want to make sure that that 18
months remains sacred. Thanks.

(Jenis):

So the - from the prior conversation we were hearing 12 to 18 month range.
So we start we'll start here. But let me hear from the registry side. So six
month a good timeframe or can it be done quicker?

(Joe Alber):

This is (Joe). I wouldnâ€™t think that we would be able to do it quicker unless we
really get in and, you know, do a more detailed analysis but there's a lot of there are a lot of moving pieces to doing that and, you know, documentation
and as well as development and testing and deployment so I think that that's
a reasonable time right now to plan.

(Jenis):

Jody go ahead.

(Joe Alber):

Sorry that was an old hand.

(Jenis):

Any other comment? So what I'm hearing is 18 months from the point of
where registry is ready to accept data.

Jeff Eckhaus:

It's Jeff again, just one clarification that for people who are like, you know,
may be freaking out because of that timeline just remember it doesn't mean
that we're going to do everything in that last month. I mean we need that
timeframe but, you know, because this hasn't been done and we would need
to test everything out. But the goal is not to wait till the last possible minute
but to have that flexibility and to try and maybe get it done at a sooner pace if
possible.

Pat Kane:

Pat Kane, Verisign. This is a question for Jeff and for Jody. In that 18 month
window what would be about the percentage of domain names that you
would have a natural expiration date if you could update expire because it
seems to me if you had to go update domain names that aren't going to
renew that that'd a lot of work for no value.

Jeff Eckhaus:

Yes it's Jeff here. I mean I'd have to say if you looked at across all of our
TLDs, you know, that we have managed on the registrars it would probably
be an average life of about a 1.4, 1.5 would be my guess which I think is
probably consistent with, you know, the Verisign registration data. There's
going to be definitely some outliers because we do have some, you know,
some very long-standing clients, some domain investors that have domains
for, you know, that are - you know, that do register them and then maybe put
on, you know, some registry lock and have it - they always keep them out for
ten years. So there's going to be a large group of people that have that. But
I'd say as an average it would probably be about a 1.4, 1.5.

Jeff Eckhaus:

Go ahead Jody.

Jody Kolker:

I don't have specific numbers on how many would be expired at that time or
would be about to expire. But I would say that we would start on registrations
that are definitely that are registered out ten years or two years or past the
expiration or the timeline date start on those and then move back. And as we
move back I would expect this to take, you know, a very long time for us to
get all these existing registrations done. So we would work as Jeff said we

ICANN
Moderator: Nathalie Peregrine
06-29-16/4:03 am CT
Confirmation # 8995675
Page 26

would start on this to be able to transition this right away. So we'd be doing
this very slowly to make sure we didn't override any systems at the registry or
in our own systems ourselves. And so we would definitely start on the
domains that would - that are set to expire after the end of the implementation
date and work our way backwards.
(Jenis):

Yes that would be a helpful note that the implementation notes that we can
remember to. Well good point. Any other comment? So this was our initial
attempt at setting a timeline. And based on your feedback we'll work on this
and come back to you.

Krista Papac:

Thanks (Jenis). It's Krista again. I have a naÃ¯ve question. I'm not the technical
person in this conversation. So from a registrar's perspective when you guys
get notified, you know, the official notification that this thing is kicking off and
here's your 18 months in that initial - in the first few months you wouldn't
actually be ready to start transitioning data. You would be building it out
project, designing your project plan and putting that together.
Would you be able to do - work that in parallel with - that's part of your 18
months that you need. And would you be able to work that in parallel with the
development work that the registries are doing so meaning like maybe that
you're not losing all of that six months because you still need some time to
like ramp up to prepare to send to the registry system?

Roger Carney:

This is Roger with GoDaddy. We've talked about that in the group actually.
And before the registrars can really start we need the specifications from the
registry. So when we get the specifications from the registry we would begin.
And I - where that happens I don't know but it won't be at the beginning of the
six months. It'll be toward the end of the six months before they can give us a
spec that actually says this is how you're going to have to do it soâ€¦

(Joe Alber):

Yes I expect we'll be working very - this is (Joe). I expect we'll be working
very closely with all of the registrars on, you know, getting all the
documentation out, testing environments and everything soâ€¦

(Jenis):

Any other comments?

Krista Papac:

(unintelligible)?

(Jenis):

Jody is this a new hand?

Jody Kolker:

Yes it is. Thanks (Jenis). I just wanted to comment on the 18 months period
from when the registry is completed and in production. We're talking about 47
million domains that need to be pushed over there over to regular contacts or
I'm sorry to thick contacts. Now we did this for .org I believe 12 years ago.
(Joe) can correct me if I'm wrong here but at that time GoDaddy had 600,000
domains. And this took quite a long time to complete. And in fact years after
this was done we were still getting notices from the registry that we had bad
contacts due to transfer in from other registrars.
Well I just want to caution everyone that this is pretty massive. .Org at that
time I think was only 1-1/2 million domains. And I think (Joe) has more
confident numbers than what I have. And we're talking about something that's
100 times as large and, you know, (unintelligible) 18 months is a big project.

(Jenis):

Thank you Jody. I've just been informed that we have another meeting
starting in this room right now. So we will have to continue our discussion
tomorrow. So come back tomorrow everyone and we'll continue. Fabien do
you have any last remarks?

Fabien Betremieux:

It will be for tomorrow. Thank you all.
