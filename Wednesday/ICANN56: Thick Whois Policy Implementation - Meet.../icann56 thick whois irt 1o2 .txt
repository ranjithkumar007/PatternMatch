Consistent Labeling & Display
Reminder: Thick Whois PDP WG Recommendation #1
¤

The provision of thick Whois services, with a consistent labelling and display as per
the model outlined in specification 3 of the 2013 RAA, should become a
requirement for all gTLD registries, both existing and future

Revisions to Policy language based on Public Comments and IRT discussion
¤
¤
¤

Display of Reseller and Registrar Expiration Date is optional (Registry vs. Registrar
Expiration Date confusion to be refered to the GNSO)
Reference to the specification 3 of 2013 RAA to be replaced by a specification of
changes applicable to registries RDDS output
‘Whois Clarifications” Advisory refered to as a complement to policy language

Transition from thin to thick – Objective
¤

- New Registrations Track
- Existing Registrations Track

¤

Release of Implementation Plan
- Implementation Plan for Public Comment: Sept.-Oct. 2016
- Policy Effective Date Anouncement: Jan. 2017

¤

Target: Transform implementation path into plan by August 2016
- Finalization of discussion of Implementation Path by Helsinki

- IRT Validation of Draft by End of August

Transition Implementation Path - Principles
Agreed upon within the IRT (as of 21 June 2016):
¤

Transition of new and existing Registrations would happen in parallel,
according to independent timelines

¤

A limited set of validation rules would be enforced by Registry Systems to
ensure all available existing registration data is transitioned
- Contact ID, Postal Info Type and Auth Info required for contacts
- RDDS output before and after the transition contains the same amount of
information

¤

2 options available to registrars for uploading existing registration data:
- EPP
- File-based bulk transfer

¤

Once exisiting registration data is transitioned, regular validation rules apply
(same as those applicable to new registrations)
