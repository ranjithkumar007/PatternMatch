HELSINKI – At-Large Leadership Work Session (Part 2)
Wednesday, June 29, 2016 – 09:15 to 10:30 EEST
ICANN56 | Helsinki, Finland

ALAN GREENBERG:

Good morning, this is ICANN 56, June 29th. This is the At-Large
Leadership Work Session part 2. Can I have your attention? Can I
have everyone's attention? Apparently not. I'll speak anyway.
Alright, we are going to continue on the selection item, that is
the selection committee and then the CSC liaison. We will then
revert to the previous item of the At-Large director kickoff. Now
I'm getting confused. Oh, we haven't started that one yet. Okay,
we'll continue on this item, we will then go on to the At-Large
director kickoff. Following that, we in theory have 45 minutes –
which we don’t – and the next scheduled item is workgroup
revitalization.
That one is not time sensitive, although we have put it off for
about three meetings now and continually bring it back on the
table. But as things go today, it is not on the highest priority, and
we will drop that one if necessary to try to complete these items.
Both these items that we're talking about, the selection
committee and then the director kickoff, are time sensitive. If we
don’t do it at this meeting and come to final decisions, I won't be
over-dramatic and say we're doomed, but we're putting
ourselves in an awkward position where we will either not make

commitments, or we will be back in a situation where the
director selection is rushed where it needn't have been rushed,
and that is not a good position to be in.
All right. If we can back up to the last slide that we didn't come
to closure on – and I don’t remember which one that is. Can we
back up the slides? Thank you. Keep going until we come to
something we recognize. Alright, that once we decided. Let's go
on to the next one. Conflict of interest. If a selection committee
member wishes to run for a position – this is a proposal, not
decided – that person must recuse him- or herself prior to the
call for candidates. The selection committee will be given a
heads up that a call for candidates is going to go out. Someone
who believes they may choose to run for it – they are not
committing to it – must recuse themselves. So they are off the
committee for that particular selection.
If the person we're talking about is an ALAC member – and this is
a proposal I wrote, I have no vested interest in it being right or
wrong, but I put words on a piece of paper. Let's not – I hope we
won't have too many alternatives for each of them. If it's an
ALAC member, it's replaced by the other ALAC members, one of
the other ALAC members from the region, decided by those
people. Or if no ALAC members from the region are available,
everyone's going to run, then the RALOs select someone. Any

HELSINKI – At-Large Leadership Work Session (Part 2)

EN

discussion? No discussion. We don’t need to make a decision.
We have discussion. Seun.

SEUN OJEDEJI:

Sorry, how does this differ from just saying the selection
committee members cannot be allowed to run for a position?
How would this be different from just giving – adding a
requirement that selection committee members are not allowed
to run for a position?

ALAN GREENBERG:

The question is, should we not simply have a rule saying
selection committee members should not run. Personal
position, other people can disagree, we're asking – these people
are committing a year ahead of time. By definition, we're trying
to put our best and most knowledgeable people – because
remember, these are the people who are going to make
recommendations to fill critical posts, so I'm presuming we will
try our best to put really knowledgeable people in this group.
We never know how many selections they're going to be doing.
They may be doing none in a year, they may be doing one or
two. This coming year, there's probably a fair number they're
going to do because of various AOC-type reviews and other
reviews coming up, and a number of selections that are

Page 3 of 48

HELSINKI – At-Large Leadership Work Session (Part 2)

EN

associated with the IANA transition. So to say, "Do not volunteer
if you may want to be on some unknown committee I the
future," I think restricts – either puts [poor] people on the
selection committee, or takes good people out of the running for
the various operational committees that we're looking at.
So my preference is not to have a blanket rule. That is, of course,
one of the options we could set. Kaili.

KAILI KAN:

Yes, thank you, Alan. Just for Seun’s discussion, I believe for
recuse himself for this specific position, not to exclude a person
that might want to run for one position to be out of all the other
selections, other positions. So I think this is much better, rather
than blanket everything. So that might exclude – who knows,
could be half of all the people who are eligible to vote, and then
it'll collapse. So I think this is much better. It'll be case by case.
Thank you.

ALAN GREENBERG:

I'll give an example. The past two ATRTs, at least one of the
people has been the current sitting ALAC Chair. That doesn’t
mean it's going to happen next time, but it has happened. The
group decided that that was the best person on a critical – very
critical, perhaps the most critical review we have in ICANN, that

Page 4 of 48

HELSINKI – At-Large Leadership Work Session (Part 2)

EN

the ALAC Chair was best able to represent the ALAC. I would not
want to say we could never do that again because we've decided
the ALAC Chair is the right person. Again, I'm not pre-supposing
who will be on this ATRT 3. Again, similarly, we have had sitting
ALAC Chairs – I'm working on the CCWG, and I couldn’t – in this
structure, I could not have been eligible.
So I would not advise saying you are ruling yourself out. We want
the best people in both the selection committee and the
positions, so I think this is a reasonable path forward. But again,
it's a proposal, not the rule. Sébastien.

SÉBASTIEN BACHOLLET:

Thank you. I need to explanation, what is for a position, and the
second is that he's or she's replaced for the time of the selection
of the position, she or he is willing to get or is replaced at the
time he or she is candidate for the rest of the mandate she or he
was supposed to have.

ALAN GREENBERG:

What I was proposing – there are no doubt an infinite number of
variations. What I was proposing is the person recuses
themselves from the selection of that position. If there are five
selections going on in parallel, that person would still
participate in the selections that they're not running for. So it is

Page 5 of 48

HELSINKI – At-Large Leadership Work Session (Part 2)

EN

a very targeted recusing. It is not for the rest of the term, it is not
for all positions, it is – they do not participate in the discussion
for that position. That’s my proposal. There's no doubt we can
have an infinite number. Go ahead, Sébastien.

SÉBASTIEN BACHOLLET:

Yes, thank you. I guess it's clear for me. My only concern here is
that what is the risk of bargaining among the members of the
committee if we do so? Thank you.

ALAN GREENBERG:

In this group, I find it hard to believe that we're going to have
that kind of situation going on. In ICANN, we always worry about
people gaming situations. We worry to the extent that when we
defined a community TLD definition, we made the rules so hard
that no one could ever pass it. When we had an applicant
support process, we made it so hard that virtually no one could
ever pass it, because we're afraid of gaming. I'd like to trust
people in this case. If we find out that there's a problem, we can
subtly – we can change it later on. I'm not sure these positions
are that important that we need to worry about making them
absolutely bulletproof to anything.
That’s, again, my position. I prefer to trust our group, and if we
see a sign of a problem, react to it, than to try to put onerous

Page 6 of 48

HELSINKI – At-Large Leadership Work Session (Part 2)

EN

rules in place. Again, I'm a somewhat trusting person. That may
not match everyone's model. Discussion. Tijani, I think you're
saying call the question, or you want to intervene.

TIJANI BEN JEMAA:

Yes, it's not a question, it is a point of order. I am not saying that
we are spending a lot of time discussing everything, and this is
normal. Everyone wants to speak, etc., but for the sake of
efficiency – and we need our rules of procedure to be adopted
this time, we have real things to do this time, so we have to be
efficient. I propose a method of working: for any issue, each
member can take the floor to explain his or her point of view. We
can make one round of people asking for the floor, including the
Chair, and then we can ask a second time if there is something to
clarify, but that’s all. And after that, we decide, and any
intervention cannot be more than two minutes. Thank you.

ALAN GREENBERG:

Thank you, Tijani, and I really mean thank you. Are there any
further questions on this one point of replacement – sorry, of the
basic point that we can have recusing for individual positions?
Any questions on it? I thought we had decided it before, but we
didn't. First paragraph is accepted, I see no dissent.

Page 7 of 48

HELSINKI – At-Large Leadership Work Session (Part 2)

SÉBASTIEN BACHOLLET:

EN

Excuse me, but what is – once again, I would like to [inaudible]
what is with a position? It's the position who are discussed in
this specific committee.

ALAN GREENBERG:

If a selection committee member wishes to run for a position,
that person must recuse themselves—

SÉBASTIEN BACHOLLET:

I am sorry—

ALAN GREENBERG:

— prior to the announcement of candidature from the selection
of that position. And that is the proposal. Kaili.

KAILI KAN:

Recused and replaced simultaneously?

ALAN GREENBERG:

Recuse says they will not participate. The next paragraphs will
talk about the replacement.

KAILI KAN:

Page 8 of 48

So these two things happen, okay then. Thank you.

HELSINKI – At-Large Leadership Work Session (Part 2)

ALAN GREENBERG:

EN

Anyone disagree strongly enough that we have to have a vote? I
see no hands.
Next bullet: if it is an ALAC member that is recusing themselves,
they will be replaced by one of the other ALAC members for the
region if available, decided by the ALAC members using
whatever method they choose. That ranges from a simple
decision, a fight in mud, drawing straws. Any disagreement?
If there are no ALAC members left, the RALO will provide a
person in lieu of an ALAC member. Again, by the RALO's own
rules. No discussion? Agreed to.
If it is a regional member that is recusing themselves, the RALO
will provide a replacement. Obviously, someone who is not
running for the – yes, Seun.

SEUN OJEDEJI:

This is just a minor comment: may I suggest that there's actually
a deadline between the time where the call for application or
call for expression of interest and the time that the person would
actually say he wants to recuse himself, so there can be enough
time for the RALOs or for the ALAC members to select a
replacement. Thank you.

Page 9 of 48

HELSINKI – At-Large Leadership Work Session (Part 2)

ALAN GREENBERG:

EN

The selection of the replacement can be done during the
duration of the call, which will normally be a week or two weeks,
so the replacement is not an issue. The person on the committee
will have to make a quick decision, because there isn't always a
lot of time between the decision to do a call and the actual call
going out. I don’t believe we need to decide on that timeframe
here. Seun, according to the rules, unless you're asking for a
clarification, we'll go on to León.

LEÓN SANCHEZ:

Thank you very much, Alan. I think that Seun's question is
answered in the slide itself: it says that the committee member
must recuse him or herself prior to the call for candidates, so
that’s the deadline, Seun.

SEUN OJEDEJI:

That is my point, actually. Prior to what Alan is saying, the thing
can happen within. You said there's going to be a replacement
prior to the call.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:

The replacement can start while the call is on. The recusal has to
happen before.

Page 10 of 48

HELSINKI – At-Large Leadership Work Session (Part 2)

EN

SEUN OJEDEJI:

Oh, okay.

ALAN GREENBERG:

Nor does it say the replacement happens before the call. The
decision to recuse happens before the call, and that person will
be given a notice, but it may not be more than a day or two. If
you don't read e-mail for two weeks, you may find you cannot
apply for a position that you otherwise would have wanted, and
that’s life.
If the Chair recuses him- or herself, the Chair will be replaced by
one of the Vice Chairs or the Vice Chair if there's only one,
barring there be a Vice Chair that’s available by another ALT
member, barring there be an ALT member available by an ALAC
member. That’s roughly equivalent to the succession rules that
we have in our rules of procedure if a Chair is no longer available
for one reason or another. Any problem with that? Are there any
cases that I have forgotten, that we care about now? No, this
slide is decided. Heidi, you have some intervention?

HEIDI ULLRICH:

Page 11 of 48

Just to read your Skype.

HELSINKI – At-Large Leadership Work Session (Part 2)

ALAN GREENBERG:

EN

Read my Skype. Heidi's Skype says – apparently Heidi can't say
it, but Heidi has Skyped me: "Alan, what will happen if the call is
sent by other staff with no notice to the ALAC? I don’t
understand how can these members recuse themselves prior." I
don’t understand the concept of a call being made without
notice to the selection committee that’s going to have to make
the call.

HEIDI ULLRICH:

Sometimes the calls come from other departments [inaudible]
selection committee for like the CCT.

ALAN GREENBERG:

Alright, Heidi is asking the following question: "What happens if
the call is made for an ATRT Review Team, or WHOIS RDS Review
Team, the call comes out from other staff, and it says 'but you
have to be endorsed by the region.'" I believe we will make a
parallel call with the specifics in it, and that is the call that will
count.

HEIDI ULLRICH:

Page 12 of 48

Thank you.

HELSINKI – At-Large Leadership Work Session (Part 2)

ALAN GREENBERG:

EN

So noted. Thank you, Heidi, for catching that. And for the record,
you're allowed to put up your hand and talk. Far more expedient
than telling me to read my Skype. Now, if you're telling me my
clothes aren't buttoned, probably you should do it privately.
Next slide. Decisions. Again, proposal. Decisions are made by
consensus if possible. We have a definition of consensus in our
rules of procedure. By majority vote if necessary, and then an
option. Is everyone happy with the first two bullets? So
consensus if possible, vote if necessary, Chair of the selection
committee to act as a tie breaker. Seun, go ahead.

SEUN OJEDEJI:

Am I right to assume that the initial vote of the majority does not
include the vote of the Chair?

ALAN GREENBERG:

That is correct.

SEUN OJEDEJI:

Okay.

ALAN GREENBERG:

Tijani.

Page 13 of 48

HELSINKI – At-Large Leadership Work Session (Part 2)

TIJANI BEN JEMAA:

EN

Seun made my point, but I will emphasize on the fact that the
Chair is a non-voting Chair, so he cannot break the tie.

ALAN GREENBERG:

You're disagreeing with point number two? How do you propose
to break the tie, may I ask?

TIJANI BEN JEMAA:

I think that, as you said, the best is to go by consensus, but if
there is no consensus, we need to make people – the minimum –
it is exactly like here: we didn't have a consensus, we have a tie.
You break the tie according to the rule of procedure. We have to
put something to break the tie, and I think that it might be
taking into account if there is a majority from the ALAC members
who are for a position, this position will be the position taken. So
the vote of the ALAC members will be preponderant.

ALAN GREENBERG:

Alright. We have a suggestion that instead of the methodology
which we actually just used for the first time, that are in the rule
of procedure for the ALAC, that instead, if there is a tie among
the whole committee, that – and obviously, any Chair is going to
try to break a tie saying, "Does anyone want to change their

Page 14 of 48

HELSINKI – At-Large Leadership Work Session (Part 2)

EN

mind?" Or whatever. But if it is a definite tie, then we have an
odd number of ALAC members, and the ALAC members rule.
Let's hear any other speakers, and then we'll take a decision
between those two. Sébastien?

SÉBASTIEN BACHOLLET:

First, I wanted to come back to the question of – is the Chair
voting? As we decided previously that it's the ALT members, we
decided previously that it's the ALT members who will represent
ALAC in the selection committee, then the Chair is one of the
members of the selection committee, he must vote like the other
members, because we need regional balance, and he's one of
the representatives. He is one of the ten people, he needs to be
able to vote. Now, when we come to the question of the tie,
there are then two solutions: one is that they are more
important member in this committee than the others, that’s to
put the ALAC representative, the ALT member in fact to decide,
or it's to have the Chair as a tie breaker, but my first point is that
the Chair is one of the members, and they have the same duty
and possibilities as the other member regarding the vote on the
selection. Thank you.

Page 15 of 48

HELSINKI – At-Large Leadership Work Session (Part 2)

ALAN GREENBERG:

EN

My recollection is there was an option for what happens with the
ALT. What was on the slide – and maybe it was my mistake, we
didn't discuss it, but if we go back to slide number three – keep
going, somehow the numbers didn't show up on these slides, I
don't know why – the recommendation was ALT members
except for the Chair 's region where one of the other ALAC
members would be selected, that was the intent there. We can
go back and revisit that, if you'd like. I don’t much care.

SÉBASTIEN BACHOLLET:

But we didn't decide anything except the ALT members, and
that’s the ALT members. And if we want to change that, okay,
then we need to add someone from the region of the Chair, but
then we have to decide who will decide that. We didn't do it. My
suggestion is that we keep the 20, the Chair is among them, and
the Chair has the same duties as the others.

ALAN GREENBERG:

That [does] make it difficult for the Chair to act as an impartial
Chair and one of the discussants. We have a queue now. Let me
first clarify what I wrote and I thought what we said, but maybe
it didn't get said, is if it is the ALT – and clearly the Chair is one of
the ALTs – we've already decided the Chair of the ALAC will
preside over the group, then it would be the ALT, except for the

Page 16 of 48

HELSINKI – At-Large Leadership Work Session (Part 2)

EN

Chair, in which case one of the other ALAC members would have
to be selected. That was certainly the intent, I don't know
whether it was understood or said at that point. We have a
speakers' queue. We have Tijani, I think we had León, and we
have Kaili.

TIJANI BEN JEMAA:

There is a slide at the beginning saying that the composition is
ten members plus the ALAC Chair, so there are ten members:
two from each region, plus the Chair, and this is how we said the
Chair is a non-voting Chair.

ALAN GREENBERG:

That’s what I thought we had said.

TIJANI BEN JEMAA:

It was on the slide.

ALAN GREENBERG:

Yeah. León.

Page 17 of 48

HELSINKI – At-Large Leadership Work Session (Part 2)

LEÓN SANCHEZ:

EN

Thank you very much. I see two possible ways here: one is to
have the Chair a voting member, the other one is to have the
Chair only vote when there's a tie, as a tie breaker.

ALAN GREENBERG:

Or we have an alternative saying it's the ALAC members that
break the tie, and I'm quite happy to accept that. I don’t care.
Kaili, quick intervention.

KAILI KAN:

Yes. I consider – no matter what, no matter whether the Chair is
a voting Chair or a non-voting Chair, if there's a tie, if he did not
vote, not his vote will break the tie. If he voted already, then
they'll vote twice just like what we [exercised] a moment ago. So
either way, in a tie, the Chair decides. Thank you.

ALAN GREENBERG:

As Tijani said, we already did decide – and we promised we
weren’t going to go back – that we would have ten members,
plus the Chair. That implies the Chair cannot act as an ALT
member and a Chair simultaneously, which implies to me we
selected someone else, which is what it said. So I think we've
decided, and I believe most people here agree, that we will have
five ALAC members, plus the Chair. The four of the five will be the

Page 18 of 48

HELSINKI – At-Large Leadership Work Session (Part 2)

EN

ALT for the Chair's region, someone else will have to step in.
Now we have a decision. Kaili, we said one intervention per
person. Seun, I don’t even recall if you had an intervention in
this subject or not, so go ahead. Go ahead, as Chair I can't recall,
so go ahead if you have something to say.

SEUN OJEDEJI:

I had an intervention before, so – I should go ahead? Okay, thank
you. I just wanted to clarify, because in the situation where the
Chair is actually going for the position, what happens when
there's a tie? Is it a replacement that assumes the same status?
Because you said – yeah.

ALAN GREENBERG:

Can we go two slides up? Thank you. If the Chair is running for a
position, the Chair will be replaced as the Chair of the selection
committee by a Vice Chair, another ALT member – which in this
case, they will have to be in turn replaced – or an ALAC member.

SEUN OJEDEJI:

Yeah, my point is that as in the case of ALAC, the replaced person
does not break the tie. Just like you said, it is the sitting Chair
that breaks the tie.

Page 19 of 48

HELSINKI – At-Large Leadership Work Session (Part 2)

ALAN GREENBERG:

EN

That is in the ALAC rules. Here, we're saying whoever is acting as
Chair of the selection committee breaks the tie.

SEUN OJEDEJI:

Okay.

ALAN GREENBERG:

There is no more powerful Chair than whoever is sitting in the
Chair's position, however they were selected.

SEUN OJEDEJI:

That is not written there, but [inaudible] thank you.

ALAN GREENBERG:

Alright, I think we have agreement that there will be ten
members. We have an option for how a tie is broken: the tie is
either broken by a majority of the voting ALAC members – of
which there will be five, hopefully, heaven help us if there are
only four at the meeting – or by this Chair, the person acting as
the current Chair of the selection committee for that particular
selection. Is there anyone here who doesn’t really care which it
is? Alright. Is there anyone who prefers the sitting Chair to take
the tiebreaking vote?

Page 20 of 48

HELSINKI – At-Large Leadership Work Session (Part 2)

EN

UNIDENTIFIED MALE:

[inaudible] option?

ALAN GREENBERG:

Yes, there will be another option, that is –

UNIDENTIFIED MALE:

[inaudible]

ALAN GREENBERG:

No, I don’t think there are any. The two options are – I believe,
and before we vote, someone correct me if I’ve missed one – the
sitting Chair of the selection committee breaks a tie, or a vote of
the ALAC members on the selection – of the voting ALAC
members – breaks the tie. Those are the two options. Vote for
the first option, the sitting Chair breaks the tie. We have one,
two, three, five. I sure hope we have more ALAC members at this
meeting now.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:

Yes, we do.

ALAN GREENBERG:

Alright. Option number two: the tie is broken – oh. Go ahead,
Gisella.

Page 21 of 48

HELSINKI – At-Large Leadership Work Session (Part 2)

GISELLA GRUBER-WHITE:

EN

Sorry, we now have 11 ALAC members seated at the table, and
we've just received an e-mail from Wafa Dahmani saying that
"Concerning the votes, I want to give a proxy to Mr. Tijani Ben
Jemaa to vote instead of me." Thank you.

ALAN GREENBERG:

Noted, Tijani now has two hands.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:

[inaudible]

ALAN GREENBERG:

We're really good at this, aren't we? Two options. We're going to
start the vote over again, because now we know who's voting.
Option number one: the tie is broken by the presiding Chair of
that selection. Note, I am not casting a vote in either, because I
really don’t care. We have five votes to say the Chair breaks the
tie. Voting to say the majority of the ALAC members break the
tie. One, two – Vanda, you're voting for this? Three, four, five.
That’s okay, that’s okay, because I reserve my vote.

SÉBASTIEN BACHOLLET:

Page 22 of 48

So do I.

HELSINKI – At-Large Leadership Work Session (Part 2)

EN

ALAN GREENBERG:

Ah, so do I. Okay, go for it, Sébastien.

SÉBASTIEN BACHOLLET:

Sorry, but it was to show if we do the ALT, the ALT could be
tiebreaking too, and then we will need the Chair to tie break
again. Let's go for the Chair.

ALAN GREENBERG:

Done. Nothing is simple.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:

[You have to] officially announce the results, please, if you
understand them.

ALAN GREENBERG:

We had six votes for the Chair breaking the tie.

SÉBASTIEN BACHOLLET:

Five.

ALAN GREENBERG:

Including yours, which was deferred without telling us it was
going to be deferred, but that’s fine. I'm willing to accept that. I

Page 23 of 48

HELSINKI – At-Large Leadership Work Session (Part 2)

EN

don’t think anyone is willing to dispute it and prolong this. We
had six votes for the Chair, and five votes for the ALAC members.
I think Sébastien's argument is compelling that it removes one
more option for a possible tie. The Chair, of course, could be
undecided, and I'm happy to support that outcome, so in fact, it
is seven to five. Tijani, you have an intervention.

TIJANI BEN JEMAA:

Yes. Thank you very much, Alan. I would like to – that my – this
point will be recorded, because for me, this is not a good thing,
because first, the same region has two votes, second, because
the Chair who is not voting will be voting in this time. So for me,
this is something that we normally should avoid. Since the
majority is for it, it's okay, but please record my point.

ALAN GREENBERG:

Noted, thank you, Tijani. Kaili?

KAILI KAN:

Thank you. I just want to add one sentence, that the tiebreaking
position – Chair, sitting Chair, whatever – may not be allowed to
vote as absentee, otherwise the tiebreaking role will not be
fulfilled.

Page 24 of 48

HELSINKI – At-Large Leadership Work Session (Part 2)

EN

ALAN GREENBERG:

I'm sorry, I didn't catch exactly what you said.

KAILI KAN:

If the presence of the Chair is to break the tie, this Chair is not
allowed to vote as absentee – not to vote as abstain, otherwise,
there's no tiebreaking.

ALAN GREENBERG:

I never even thought of that as an option, that the Chair would
choose to do that. What Kaili is saying is that the Chair can't
abstain.

SÉBASTIEN BACHOLLET:

That is not tiebreaking.

KAILI KAN:

Just to make it clear, spell it out. I understand that’s implied, but
to spell it out is better.

ALAN GREENBERG:

Thank you. As you recall, I read the rules of our rules of
procedure, we never thought to include that as an option, but
noted. Yes, I think you are certainly correct. If you take on a

Page 25 of 48

HELSINKI – At-Large Leadership Work Session (Part 2)

EN

position of being Chair, you take on the responsibilities. Thank
you, we have now completed that. Next slide.
That, we already did. Next slide. Alright, I believe we have now
fully – no, sorry, there was one more item on the previous slide
we didn't cover yet. Previous slide. The third bullet, this was an
issue brought up on the mailing list. There were two positions.
One was for positions that are representative of the ALAC – that
is liaisons to ACs and SOs, because we do use the term liaison for
other positions – for liaisons to ACs and SOs – and currently we
have three of them to the GNSO, to the ccNSO and now to the
GAC; round of applause – that if there is not a decision by
consensus, the decision will be made by the ALAC members on
this committee. That is option number two.
Option number one is the decision we made, like all other
decisions, by the entire group, and of course with the
tiebreaking rule we have already determined. Can we have any
discussions people want to speak for or against one of those
things?
The substance of the argument – which I will not make as an
intervener, but the substance of the argument is these are
people who are selected to speak on behalf of the ALAC, and
although it has to be ratified by the ALAC, of course, we don’t
want a position where the non-ALAC members end up forcing

Page 26 of 48

HELSINKI – At-Large Leadership Work Session (Part 2)

EN

the decision, which will then have to be potentially rejected by
the ALAC. So it says we welcome the regional people to
participate in the discussion and/or try to dissuade, but the
actual recommendation comes from ALAC members. The
alternative is it comes from the whole group as for other
selections. Discussants, we have Tijani first.

TIJANI BEN JEMAA:

Thank you, Alan. In my point of view, all the selections are done
by the selection committee, but the selection committee is not
deciding, they are recommending to the ALAC. So the final word
is for the ALAC. So in any case, let the selection committee do all
the selections, and at the end, the ALAC may accept or reject
those selections. That’s why I prefer that, and as much as you
widen the number of people who are voting, you have better
decision in my point of view, because you have better views. And
don’t forget that we are a bottom-up organization. We always
say that we have the bottom-up decision-making organization,
so try to be the most wide to have decision. Thank you.

ALAN GREENBERG:

Thank you. Would anyone else like to speak before we decide?
Kaili.

Page 27 of 48

HELSINKI – At-Large Leadership Work Session (Part 2)

KAILI KAN:

EN

First of all, I have to agree with Tijani. Well, we won't have the
biggest, widest democracy, however, as we are bottom-up,
we're not going to be [part of the] bottom. So at a certain stage,
we need to go up, which means just like the e-mail discussed,
democracy does have a limit. So if it's some kind – well, some
other methods should be exercised. Thank you.

ALAN GREENBERG:

As Tijani pointed out, should the recommendation be made by
the entire group, which is rejected by the ALAC, it would have to
go back to the group, and who knows what would happen next.
So the ultimate decision of to accept the recommendation or
not – and remember, this committee might, in any given
instance, make, you know, say, “We have three people that are
good, the ALAC decides,” or it might say, "We have reviewed
them, we believe this is the right person, period. The others may
be capable, but this is the correct person." That’s up to the
selection committee to decide how to do that. But should the
selection committee come up with a recommendation where
none of the alternatives are acceptable to the ALAC, the ALAC
could remand it, and you could have an infinite loop at that
point. That’s why I have a slight preference for the ALAC
members, just because it should remove that possibility. Anyone
else want to speak before we vote? Seun.

Page 28 of 48

HELSINKI – At-Large Leadership Work Session (Part 2)

SEUN OJEDEJI:

EN

Yes, just a quick one. I assume that by one of the committee
members recusing himself, also means that the person will also
recuse himself from the ALAC decision on the recommendation.

ALAN GREENBERG:

That has never been our practice, and I don’t believe I'm
proposing that now.

SEUN OJEDEJI:

Okay, thank you.

ALAN GREENBERG:

With the one exception of Board member selection, which is in a
different category, we have never had people recuse themselves
– we have on rare occasions had someone saying, "Since I'm a
candidate, I won't vote." That’s a personal decision, but in
general, people have not done that, so I see no reason to
introduce it at this point. Any further comments before we vote?
All right, I'll call the vote. ALAC members who would prefer to
see all decisions made by the full selection committee, all
recommendations, and then go to the ALAC – does have the

Page 29 of 48

HELSINKI – At-Large Leadership Work Session (Part 2)

EN

possibility of recursion. Probably not likely though, but it does.
Hands, please. Hands, cards.

KAILI KAN:

Excuse me, can you please spell out the two we're voting to
options, and then we can make the decision.

ALAN GREENBERG:

Thank you for the reminder again, I'm slow today. The two
options will be decisions for AC/SO liaisons – sorry,
recommendations for AC/SO liaisons that are being made to the
ALAC will be made either by the entire selection committee
using the rules we've already determined for non-voting and
tiebreaking and whatever, and option number two will be if we
don’t have a clear consensus, then it is the five voting ALAC
members who will make the recommendation.

TIJANI BEN JEMAA:

Sorry, it wasn’t that, your proposal, Alan.

ALAN GREENBERG:

It wasn’t?

Page 30 of 48

HELSINKI – At-Large Leadership Work Session (Part 2)

TIJANI BEN JEMAA:

EN

No, this is a tiebreaking. You are speaking about breaking the tie
now.

ALAN GREENBERG:

No.

TIJANI BEN JEMAA:

You said if there is no consensus.

ALAN GREENBERG:

Consensus by the definition that we use in the rules of
procedure, which by definition – unless altered – we use
everywhere else, is about 80%. So if we don’t have a clear
consensus, that is the majority of everyone, which implies the –
well, I'm not sure it implies the majority of the ALAC, but if it's
not a clear decision, then the ALAC members make the decision,
is what this is implying. We'll try to word it clearer. There didn't
seem to be a lot of merit to write bylaw type language for all of
the options ahead of time. I hope I'm forgiven for that. There are
only so many hours in my day. So the two options – if it comes
down to a vote, let us say, then it is either done by the whole
group, or just by the ALAC members. Those are the two options.
Is there any question on what the meaning is? Yes, go ahead,
Kaili.

Page 31 of 48

HELSINKI – At-Large Leadership Work Session (Part 2)

KAILI KAN:

EN

Just you mentioned done by the five ALAC members within the
selection committee, or...

ALAN GREENBERG:

We're talking about within the selection committee, of which –

KAILI KAN:

[inaudible] selection committee, but what I heard from Tijani is if
the recommendation is disliked by the entire ALAC group, then
the ALAC can throw the recommendation back to ask the
selection committee to reselect. These are two separate things
[inaudible] confused what am I going to vote for.

ALAN GREENBERG:

I will try to qualify. Regardless of who selects on the selection
committee, it is always possible to have the ALAC reject it. Even
the people who selected them on the selection committee can
decide by the time they get to the ALAC to reject it, and there are
ten ALAC members who are not on the selection committee, so
rejection by the ALAC is always possible, regardless of how the
selection is made. If the selection is rejected, we revert back to
the selection committee. We could iterate forever on that, and to

Page 32 of 48

HELSINKI – At-Large Leadership Work Session (Part 2)

EN

be honest, I'm not trying to cover that case. We will cover it by
an ad hoc process if we get to it.
All we're looking at is how the recommendation is made to the
ALAC. What the ALAC does with it is not our business today. The
selection will be done by the full committee, or by just the ALAC
members if there is not a clear consensus. I am calling the
question at this point. I would like to see a show of hands or
cards of ALAC members for those who would prefer the full
committee to take a vote if there is no obvious answer by
consensus. Tijani, are you voting twice? Thank you.
This is a vote only of ALAC members, please. Yes, this is a
decision of the ALAC. Can we please have staff count the ALAC
members who have their hands up or cards up? I count one, two,
three, four, five, six, seven, eight. I have chosen not to reserve my
vote at this point. Tim, are you voting in one direction or
another?

TIMOTHY DENTON:

Yes.

ALAN GREENBERG:

All right. Now, who would prefer only the ALAC members to
make the decision?

Page 33 of 48

HELSINKI – At-Large Leadership Work Session (Part 2)

UNIDENTIFIED MALE:

EN

You had the ALAC members, and then you had – The previous
vote was in relation to proposition what? Sorry.

ALAN GREENBERG:

This is a vote of whether on the selection committee, if there was
not a clear decision by consensus on who to recommend, is the
decision made by a vote of all ten members of the selection
committee, or by just the five ALAC members of the selection
committee.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE:

And I am for the five ALAC members [inaudible].

ALAN GREENBERG:

Your vote. Okay, now, we are now taking the second option.
Those who would prefer to see just the five ALAC members
participating, we have Jimmy, León, Tim, and we had how many
in the other direction? Eight. So I have a small preference for the
ALAC, so that means the whole committee votes. Decided. Next
slide.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE:

Page 34 of 48

Wait, so fifth or sixth...

HELSINKI – At-Large Leadership Work Session (Part 2)

EN

ALAN GREENBERG:

CSC liaison.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:

Yes.

ALAN GREENBERG:

I note that it is 10:15 right now. The proposed schedule is the
following: the call for selection – remember, to select the CSC
liaison, we need a selection committee. We have just decided on
how that selection committee is selected, and the rules by which
it will operate. These will be formally documented. To select the
CSC liaison – and to recall for those who don’t memorize every
acronym in ICANN, there is a committee that will be populated
largely by customers of the IANA names function – that is
registries – to verify on a regular basis that the IANA function is
performing well. There are a number of metrics they will verify.
They will look at complaints. There are some other functions of
this committee, which have to do with how major problems are
handled, so it is a relatively important group.
The group allows for optional liaisons from a variety of other
groups, including the ALAC. Since we made a lot of noise to
make sure we were included, because the first versions did not

Page 35 of 48

HELSINKI – At-Large Leadership Work Session (Part 2)

EN

include us, it would be sort of a good thing if we met the
deadline and submitted a name. If we don’t meet the deadline,
there's nothing to prevent us from adding someone later, but
the CSC liaisons are vetted by the GNSO and ccNSO – or maybe
by the Registries Stakeholder Group and the ccNSO, I think.
They are asking for two people, because they want to be able to
use the liaisons – among others – as a way to get diversity within
the group. So if possible, we are to provide two names. There are
some very significant qualifications to this rule, so that it is quite
possible we will not have two names of people who volunteer
who actually have the expertise. Whatever comes out of that,
comes out. It is possible we'll have zero, but we're certainly
going to try.
By definition, there's not too many people in our group who run
registries, and yet that’s pretty much a pre-requisite, so it's an
interesting positon we're put in. So the sequence is we will have
a call for selection committee members based on the rules that
we have determined today, as soon as practical. That might
mean the beginning of next week or something like that, but as
soon as practical. There will be a call for the CSC member,
hopefully issued on the coming Wednesday.
There is a significant wording effort that has to do with
identifying the qualifications for this person. It is partially done.

Page 36 of 48

EN

HELSINKI – At-Large Leadership Work Session (Part 2)

It is not completed, but my target is to get it out by the 4th. We
may miss the target, but that is the target. Deadline of about
July 13th. By then, we're hoping we will have the selection
committee identified. We are asking for very quick turnaround
from the RALOs to identify their person on the selection
committee. The selection committee will be convened on or
about the 18th of July.
The selection committee will meet, presumably the people will
have reviewed all the applications – if there are any – and will
make

a

recommendation

in

a

single

meeting.

That

recommendation will go to the ALT for ratification, relatively
short vote, in time to make the deadline of the 22nd of July. That
is a very aggressive timeline on pretty much all counts, but we
could do it with some difficulty. Comments and questions? We
have a speakers list. I'm not sure who put their hand up first, but
I'll go Tijani and then Seun.

TIJANI BEN JEMAA:

Thank you very much, Alan. Your timeline is very clear. There is a
third bullet point, which is a repetition of the first. We can
remove it and replace it by another bullet point, which is set up
the requirements for the CSC position, and I think that we have
to do it perhaps these days, very soon, because we cannot call
for candidate if we don’t have the requirements.

Page 37 of 48

HELSINKI – At-Large Leadership Work Session (Part 2)

EN

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:

Yes.

ALAN GREENBERG:

Just to be clear, we do have the requirements. They're in about
six different documents, and I'm trying to put it all together into
one e-mail. We can do it by a committee if you want, but to be
honest –

TIJANI BEN JEMAA:

I didn't say a committee, but send it, make it visible so that the
selection will be done according to it.

ALAN GREENBERG:

It is a more complex thing than – we have several documents. To
be honest, they disagree with each other, because the CWG set
up some specific rules. The actual call for membership put out
by the ccNSO and the GNSO did not quite follow those rules, and
I was trying to juggle them and I got involved in actually running
this meeting instead of doing it. I will finish it within the next day
or so, but if anyone else would like to volunteer to take it over,
that’s fine too. But it should go out by next Monday. So I'm sorry,
yes, I did duplicate two items. I apologize for that. The item

Page 38 of 48

HELSINKI – At-Large Leadership Work Session (Part 2)

EN

you're suggesting adding is in fact implied in the second bullet
right now.
Seun. Done. Anyone else have any comments? It's aggressive, I
believe it's doable. It's going to mean everyone can't take all
next week off, I'm hoping that we'll have some people who will
be able to do the staff work on that. Hearing no comments, we
have agreement. This item is finished.
At-Large director kickoff. There's a new presentation for that,
please. It's a very short presentation. In terms of timing, we have
ten minutes left for this somewhat critical item, but when the
slides were done, it was acknowledged that we had already
missed a number of deadlines, and that some things we had
hoped to decide in this meeting will not be decided in the
meeting, and I think we'll be okay if we don’t have too much
discussion.
Is this an etch-a-sketch or something? All right. I will read what it
says. It says, “Board member selection kickoff.” The date is
intact, as long as we don’t move a cursor over it. I thought only
Adobe Connect does this, but apparently, it's something else
that does it, too. There is one slide. Can we please go to the next
slide and don’t put the – too late. When we come to the line in
question, I will read it to you. These are the tasks that we must
carry out: we must select the Chair of the BCEC. For those who

Page 39 of 48

HELSINKI – At-Large Leadership Work Session (Part 2)

EN

do not memorize acronyms, that is the Board Candidate – I don’t
remember what the E means.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:

Evaluation.

ALAN GREENBERG:

Evaluation, thank you. Committee. This is the group that does
the call for expressions of interest. Someone has their speaker
on. Creates the call for expression of interest. We do have
models to use from the previous year. Evaluates them and
makes a recommendation to the electors. The electors are the
15 ALAC members and the five RALO Chairs. Unfortunately, an
even number. We seem to specialize in that. And that committee
basically is – that is the job. There's a little bit more to it. There
are options for RALOs nominating, adding petitions and a
number of things like that, but essentially, the BCEC accepts
expressions of interest, creates a slate.
There is a BMSPC, Board Member Selection Process Committee.
This is the group that essentially oversees the entire election,
entire selection, with the exception of tasks that are directly
attributable to the BCEC or directly attributable to the ALAC. The
third issue is to call for BCEC members. The membership is
specified in our rules of procedure, and in fact, it is decided in

Page 40 of 48

HELSINKI – At-Large Leadership Work Session (Part 2)

EN

the parts of the rules of procedure that we are in the process of
revising. One of the reasons we cannot go quite where we
wanted to this meeting – aside from lack of time – is we haven't
approved the rules yet, but the concept does not change.
We must issue a call for BMSPC members. We must assemble the
guidelines and principles and other documents. We have a vast
amount of information, because we compiled a lot prior to the
first process. The first process, which was run by Cheryl in both
the BMSPC and the BCEC, created a full number of documents
and such. The second process, where the Chair of the BMSPC
was Tijani and the Chair of the BCEC was Roberto Gaetano,
unfortunately – for reasons that are not quite clear – some of the
original documents seem to have gotten lost at that point.
They also created some of their own, perhaps in competition
with or in addition to the others. We have to do some work, we
have to assign our archivist to go back in the documents and
pull them together. There is a bit of question – one of the
questions in the rules of procedure is who sets these guidelines
that we will be discussing when we get back to the rules of
procedure, I hope discussing shortly. But those documents
[inaudible] need to be pulled together, essentially in time for the
committees to be convened. The intent is that both of these
committees should be able to be convened by the end of July.

Page 41 of 48

HELSINKI – At-Large Leadership Work Session (Part 2)

EN

That means we have a moderately short time to do the selection
and pull our documents together, and as I said, there's some
question on the table of exactly the process for pulling the
correct documents together. We'll decide that in the rules
discussion, not today.
Is there any discussion here, or problem with the timelines and
issues that are listed? Seeing none, we have a work plan going
forward. We have four minutes off. I don’t think we want to
revert to a discussion of rules and procedure for four minutes, it
would take us that long to get the documents on the screen. You
are released. Thank you all, and Tijani has an intervention
before I say the thank you.

TIJANI BEN JEMAA:

Yes, thank you very much, Alan. I propose that Cheryl and
myself, we try to compile all the guidelines of the first round and
the second round, and I personally commit to have this ready for
July as we said. I hope that Cheryl accepts that, and then it is up
to the ALAC to change it, modify it, etc.

ALAN GREENBERG:

I would like to leave decision offline for who does what to whom
and with whom. We just don’t need to decide that as a group.

Page 42 of 48

HELSINKI – At-Large Leadership Work Session (Part 2)

EN

TIJANI BEN JEMAA:

Okay, no problem.

ALAN GREENBERG:

The ALAC – if the BMSPC and the BCEC are to start their work at
the end of July, then the ALAC meeting in the last week of July
will have to approve the rules. That puts a timeline on it. If we
miss that deadline, then we'll approve them offline a week later
or so. So we have a bit of flexibility. Yes.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:

I think there's a remote participation.

ALAN GREENBERG:

There is a remote participation question or comment or
something.

ARIEL LIANG:

Just a question. For the ALAC members that haven't voted for
any of those decisions, what's your suggestion regarding followup, if any?

Page 43 of 48

HELSINKI – At-Large Leadership Work Session (Part 2)

ALAN GREENBERG:

EN

We have made all of our decisions. The votes are over. Sorry, I
can't hear what you're saying.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:

So no need to check with them.

ALAN GREENBERG:

We have the option on a vote to extend the vote by several days
to try to get absent members. I do not believe – and I heard no
call doing that here. Decisions were made, we had quorum. All
ALAC members were technically in this city or had a proxy here,
past the first [inaudible]. If people have not voted, then they
didn't vote. There's a hand from the back of the room, I'm not
sure who it is.

ADEEL SADIQ:

Hello, everyone. For the record, I am Adeel Sadiq, a NextGen
ambassador from Pakistan. Can an outsider like myself
comment? I'm not sure about your rules.

ALAN GREENBERG:

You can comment. Sorry, a quick comment, because we are on
very tight timeline.

Page 44 of 48

HELSINKI – At-Large Leadership Work Session (Part 2)

ADEEL SADIQ:

EN

About the clause in which you decided that Chair could break
the tie. So, will the Chair be using his vote only when there is a
tie, or will he be voting even before that?

ALAN GREENBERG:

It depends on which rule you're using about the Chair with the
tie. We've used that rule twice in two different instances today.
There is an ALAC rule that says should there be a tie, there are
many ways of resolving it, one of which is the Chair breaks the
tie, which implies a second vote. If we're talking about the
selection committee, the Chair is normally a non-voting
position, and the Chair would be exercising the first – the vote.
So it depends on which breaking the tie you're talking about.
Thank you.
Any more interventions? Then I thank you all, I thank our
interpreters for putting up with us, and any time I've heard an
interpretation, it's been good. We, as the ALAC – rather, At-Large
leadership, ALAC and regional leaders, are not reconvening
today, I believe. I'll turn it over to staff to announce what there is
the rest of the day.
I will note that tomorrow, we have a significant number of
meetings. They start at 9:15. May I remind all ALAC members
that these are not optional meetings, they are obligatory

Page 45 of 48

HELSINKI – At-Large Leadership Work Session (Part 2)

EN

meetings. If you are not going to be at a meeting, please let staff
know where you are instead. As you've seen here, we have votes.
We have lots of votes. It would be nice to include everyone, and
certainly include everyone in the discussions. I thank you all for
putting up with me and the number of mistakes I've made. Most
of these slides were done at about 1:00 last night, and obviously,
not with as much care as they should have been done. So for
that, I apologize. Any further comments before I turn it over to
staff for a recount of what's going on the rest of the day? Dev.

DEV ANAND TEELUCKSINGH: So what about the working group revitalization topic? That’s
going to be rescheduled.

ALAN GREENBERG:

It will be rescheduled again for some time after this meeting. We
do not have time for it. Unfortunate, but not the highest priority
today. I turn it over to staff.

GISELLA GRUBER-WHITE:

Thank you, Alan. The next session in this room is the At-Large
Outreach and Engagement Working Group, running from 10:45
to 12:00. We also have the At-Large Review Working Party
meeting running from 12:00 to 1:30. That is essentially for the

Page 46 of 48

HELSINKI – At-Large Leadership Work Session (Part 2)

EN

working party members in the Aurora Hall next door. And join us
this afternoon, we have the joint AFRALO-AfrICANN meeting in
this same room from 1:30 to 3:00, and in Aurora Hall next door,
we will have the NARALO monthly meeting.
We have two Cross-Community sessions this afternoon, one of
which is the Country and Other Geographic Names Forum, which
will be held in Helsinki Hall from 3:15 to 4:45, and then the Draft
Framework of Principle for Future CCWGs from 5:00 to 6:30 in
Hall A. At 6:30, there will be the same format as last night, only
this time it will be the Chairman's cocktail from 6:30 to 7:30 in
Piazza. And just a reminder, tomorrow morning we do have two
working group meetings, the Capacity Building Working Group
as well as the Technology Taskforce Working Group running
parallel in our two ALAC rooms, and as Alan said, all ALAC
members, if you are not able to attend, please do send your
proxy and apologies to staff. [inaudible] we have 14 ALAC
members here in Helsinki, and we have received a proxy for the
15th, so that would be much appreciated. Thank you.

ALAN GREENBERG:

And in addition to proxies and apologies, where you will be. We
do record attendance of these meetings. Last thing is I will point
out that the afternoon sessions are sessions for everyone.
They're not vacation days, so please, pick which ones you want.

Page 47 of 48

There are several things going on in parallel at some times, not
all, and I note there is an At-Large leadership meeting scheduled
against the Geographic Names. It was cancelled, but it didn't get
removed from the schedule. So we do not have an At-Large
leadership meeting this afternoon, despite the agenda showing
it.

There will be a Geo Names, it will be happening, [inaudible]
