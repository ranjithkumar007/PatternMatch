Introduction and Brief Update

Snapshot of the RPMs to be reviewed in the two phases of this PDP
Sunrise Registration Period
and Trademark Claims
Notification Services (Phase
One)
• Sunrise services provide TM
holders with advance opportunity
to register domain names
corresponding to their marks
before names are generally
available to the public
• The Trademark Claims period
follows the Sunrise period and
runs for at least the first 90 days
in which domain names are
generally made available
• TM Claims Notice is sent to a
potential registrant whose
domain matches that of a TM
record in the TMCH
• TM owner is notified if registrant
proceeds

Trademark Clearinghouse (Phase
One)
• A global database of verified trademark
information to support rights protection
processes
• Benefits of inclusion are access to Sunrise
Period and Trademark Claims Service

Trademark Post-Delegation
Dispute Resolution Procedure
(Phase One)
• Allows a TM owner to act directly
against a New gTLD Registry Operator
whose affirmative conduct supports
TM infringement at the top or second
level of its gTLD

Uniform Rapid Suspension
Dispute Resolution
Procedure (Phase One)
• Designed as a complement to
the UDRP, to provide TM owners
with a quick and low-cost
process to suspend domain
names on the same substantive
grounds as the UDRP
• Burden of proof and remedies
are not the same as UDRP

Uniform Dispute Resolution Policy
(UDRP) (Phase Two)
• Created in 1999
• Provides a uniform, standardized alternative
dispute resolution procedure to resolve
disputes concerning who is the rightful holder
of a registered domain name
• Applicable to all domains registered in all
generic top-level domains (gTLDs) – Phase
One RPMs apply only to gTLDs delegated
under the 2012 New gTLD Program round

Reviewing Community Feedback on the Scope
of the PDP

1. The Trademark Clearinghouse (TMCH) (1)
Current Charter Questions
1.
2.

3.

4.

5.

Should further guidance on verification guidelines for
different categories of marks be considered?
Is the protection of the TMCH too broad? Is the TMCH
providing too much protection for those with a trademark
on a generic or descriptive dictionary word? Should TM+50
be reversed?
Are legitimate noncommercial, commercial and individual
registrants losing legitimate opportunities to register
domain names in New gTLDs?
How should the TMCH scope be limited to apply to only
the categories of goods and services in which the generic
terms in a trademark are protected?
Should the TMCH matching rules be expanded, e.g. to
include plurals, ‘marks contained’ or ‘mark+keyword’,
and/or common typos of a mark?

Retain/Delete/Modify?

1. The Trademark Clearinghouse (TMCH) (2)
Current Charter Questions
6.

Should there be an additional or a different recourse
mechanism to challenge rejected trademarks?
7. How quickly can a cancelled trademark be removed from
the TMCH?
8. How can TMCH services be much more transparent in
terms of what is offered pursuant to ICANN contracts and
policies vs. what is offered to private New gTLD registries
pursuant to private contracts?
9. Should there be a review on accessibility to TMCH for
individuals, private trademark holders and trademark
agents in developing countries?
10. How can the TMCH provide education services not only for
trademark owners, but for the registrants and potential
registrants who are equally impacted by their services?

Retain/Delete/Modify?

2. Sunrise Registration Periods
Current Charter Questions
1. Should the availability of Sunrise registrations only for
“identical matches” (e.g. without extra generic text) be
reviewed?
2. Is the notion of ”premium names” relevant to a review of
RPMs, and, if so, should it be defined across all gTLDs?
Should there be a mechanism to challenge whether a
domain is a ‘premium name’?
3. Should there be a specific policy about the reservation and
release of “reserved names” (e.g. modification of Section
1.3.3 of Specification 1 of the current Registry Agreement)?
4. Should there be a public, centralized list of all reserved
trademarks for any given Sunrise period?
5. Should holders of TMCH-verified trademarks be given first
refusal once a reserved name is released?
6. Should Sunrise periods continue to be mandatory? If so,
should the current requirements apply or should they be
more uniform, such as a 60-day end-date period?
7. Whether and how to develop a mechanism by which
trademark owners can challenge Sunrise pricing practices
that flout the purpose of Sunrise
8. Whether more can be done to improve transparency and
communication about various Sunrise procedures

Retain/Delete/Modify?

3. Trademark Claims Notifications
Current Charter Questions
1. Should the Trademark Claims period be extended beyond
ninety (90) days?
2. Should the Trademark Claims period continue to apply to all
new gTLDs?
3. Should the Abused Domain Name Label service be
continued?
4. Does a Trademark Claims period create a potential “chilling
effect” on genuine registrations, and, if so, how should this
be addressed?
5. Is the TMCH and the Sunrise Period allowing key domain
names to be cherry picked and removed from New gTLDs
unrelated to those of the categories of goods and services
of the trademark owner?
6. What is the effect of the 90-day Trademark Claims process?
7. Should notices to the trademark owner be sent before the
domain is registered?

Retain/Delete/Modify?

4. Uniform Rapid Suspension (URS) dispute resolution procedure (1)
Current Charter Questions
1. Should the ability for defaulting respondents to file a reply
for an extended after the default notice, or even after a
default determination is issued be changed?
2. Is the URS’ ‘clear and convincing’ standard of proof
appropriate?
3. Is there a need to develop express provisions to deal with
‘repeat offenders’ as well as a definition of what qualifies as
‘repeat offences’?
4. Should the URS allow for additional remedies such as a
perpetual block or other remedy, e.g. transfer or a “right of
first refusal” to register the domain name in question?
5. Is the current length of suspension (to the balance of the
registration period) sufficient?
6. Is the cost allocation model for the URS appropriate and
justifiable?
7. Should there be a “loser pays” model? How can that be
enforced if the respondent does not respond?
8. Should the Response Fee applicable to complainants listing
15 or more disputed domain names by the same registrant
be eliminated?

Retain/Delete/Modify?

4. Uniform Rapid Suspension (URS) dispute resolution procedure (2)
Current Charter Questions
9.
10.
11.
12.

13.

Has ICANN done its job in training registrants in the new
rights and defenses of the URS?
Are the expanded defenses of the URS being used and if
so, how, when, and by whom?
What sanctions should be allowed for misuse of the URS
by the trademark owner?
What evidence is there of problems with the use of the
English-only requirement of the URS, especially given its
application to IDN New gTLDs?
How can the appeals process of the URS be expanded
and improved?

Working Group Questions and Provider Responses (1)
Question to Provider

Provider Responses

WIPO:
• High-level	DRP,	non-use	 doesn’t	 mean	it’s	 not	
needed.	
• Substantive	reasons	 and	many	procedural	layers:	
Ø

What are the possible reasons for the
TM-PDDRP not having been used to
date?

no willful blindness standard, two-pronged
affirmative conduct requirement, burden of
proof, remedies, applicability to registrars,
ICANN’s role in implementation, failure to
expressly allow class/joined complaints.

ADNDRC:
• Burden	of	proof	may	be	difficult	 to	discharge,	
especially	 for	second	 level	infringements
• Top-level	infringements	 possibly	 minimized	by	
existence	of	pre-delegation	objection	 processes,	
TMCH	and	SDRP
• Remedies	may	not	be	useful	 for	second	 level	
infringements
FORUM:
• High	substantive	 standards,	particularly	at	the	
second	 level
• Procedure	may	not	be	well-known
• Unspecific	 nature	of	the	remedies.

| 19

Working Group Questions and Provider Responses (2)
Question to Provider

Provider Responses

WIPO:	Case	filing	fees	support	 case	administration.

Is there an ongoing cost to retain the
Procedure even if it is not used?

ADNDRC:	Yes	- System	maintenance;	staff	training;	
business	 development.	
FORUM:	No.	

| 20

Working Group Questions and Provider Responses (3)
Question to Provider

Have you received feedback from any
trademark owners or registry operators
about potential problems or concerns
with the Procedure?

Provider Responses

WIPO:	Some	(along	the	lines	 of	the	topics	outlined	 in	
response	 to	Q1).
ADNDRC:	No.
FORUM:	No.

| 21

Working Group Questions and Provider Responses (4)
Question to Provider

Provider Responses

WIPO:	See	response	 to	Q3.

Have you received any enquiries from
potential complainants who
nevertheless did not proceed?

ADNDRC:	Yes,	a	couple	of	enquiries	 regarding	the	
proceedings	 flow,	case	filing	fee	and	available	
remedies	but	did	not	hear	further	from	them.
FORUM:	Very	few	enquiries	 about	the	general	purpose	
of	the	TM-PDDRP	(what	does	it	do?).	On	a	couple	of	
occasions,	 parties	who	were	facing	a	potential	loss	 in	a	
pre-delegation	TMCH	proceeding	enquired	 about	a	
potential	TM-PDDRP	filing	post-delegation.

| 22

Working Group Questions and Provider Responses (5)
Question to Provider

Provider Responses

WIPO:	Yes.

Are you operationally ready should a
complaint be filed?

ADNDRC:	Yes.
FORUM:	Yes.

| 23

Working Group Questions and Provider Responses (6)
Question to Provider

Provider Responses

WIPO:	Yes.

Have you selected panelists?

ADNDRC:	Yes.
FORUM:	Yes.

| 24

Working Group Questions and Provider Responses (7)
Question to Provider

Should mediation be added to the
Procedure?

Provider Responses
WIPO:
• Difficult	to	positively	 answer	given	the	additional	
layers	to	the	process	that	were	created.
• Difficult	to	justify	 if	merely	an	additional	 layer	- but	
a	mediation	component	 might	be	useful	 if	it	serves	
to	assist	the	parties	in	considering	 tailored	
settlement	options	 or	remedies	(or	e.g.,	to	
supplant	 the	role	of	the	Threshold	 Review	Panel)
ADNDRC:
• Could	 be	an	effective	means	of	resolving	disputes	
in	a	time	and	cost	efficient	manner
• Note	possible	 adverse	effect	on	panelist’s	
neutrality	after	having	obtained	confidential	
information	from	a	party	during	a	fruitless	
mediation.
FORUM:
• Not	recommended	 if	mandatory,	though	an	
optional	 step	could	be	considered	 (but	note	
additional	 fees	if	mediation	is	unsuccessful).	
• Does	not	believe	that	adding	a	mediation	step	will	
have	a	significant	influence	 on	triggering	filings.
| 25

Working Group Questions and Provider Responses (8)
Question to Provider

Provider Responses
WIPO:
See	generally	response	 to	Q3;	bear	in	mind	that	the	
TM-PDDRP	is	part	of	the	“tapestry”	of	protections	
created	for	the	New	gTLD Program.
ADNDRC:
More	concrete	wordings	for	available	remedies,	 e.g.:

Do you have any additional feedback
about the TM-PDDRP at this stage?

• Amount	of	monetary	damages	or	sanctions	other	 than	
the	cost	of	proceedings	
• Actual	direct	actions	by	 the	registry	operator	contrary	
to	those	required	under	 the	Registry	Agreement	

FORUM:
• ICANN	Compliance	 has	been	influential	 in	
controlling	registrars	and	registries:	potential	filer	
may	not	file	under	TM-PDDRP	- goes	directly	to	
ICANN	Compliance
• Although	it	has	not	been	used	so	far,	cannot	be	
certain	that	it	is	unnecessary
• Solidifying	 remedies	could	potentially	 trigger	
filings
• Example	cases	could	be	helpful	 to	indicate	why	it	
hasn’t	been	used	 so	far

| 26

Additional Suggestions and Follow Up Questions
SUGGESTIONS:
• WG should also seek feedback from panelists/arbitrators, especially those
who have been trained in the PDDRP or who have extensive experience
with similar administrative proceedings or arbitration (from ADNDRC and
WG members)
• More promotional events can be hosted jointly by ICANN, providers and
registry operators (from ADNDRC)
QUESTIONS:
• Do you have any knowledge of why the potential complainants who
enquired did not proceed to filing?
• Looking over the PDDRP, are there any requirements that present
administrative challenges?
• Do you believe that the lack of use of the PDDRP results from a lack of
instances of the abuse it was designed to target, or are there cost or
evidentiary elements that discourage potential complaints?

| 27

Policy questions for the Working Group in reviewing the TM-PDDRP
1. Is there a policy-based need to address the goal of the TM-PDDRP?
2. Is it broad enough to cover abuses that were not anticipated when it was developed?
Alternatively, do we still need it?
3. There is an overarching Charter question as to whether the RPMs collectively fulfill the
objectives for which they were developed. In this context, are there some
policies/procedures that should be carried across all mechanisms (assuming applicability)
e.g. costs/fees for the prevailing party? Should the standards be changed to address the full
range of conduct that may appropriately be sanctioned by this process?
4. Even if we made no changes to the TM-PDDRP, is there any burden to it remaining available
for use should an appropriate case arise? Or would changes make it more useful?
5. Given how much it costs to be a registry operator, is it too easy to bring a TM-PDDRP
action?
6. Concerning TMCH/sunrise practices, certain registries charged fees that some considered
disproportionately high for trademark owners. Is there any relation between the sunrise
registration fees for trademark owners, in particular registries, to the conduct of the registry
operator itself that would be relevant to think about in the post-delegation context?
7. Would adding mediation to the PDDRP be advisable?
