ccNSO SOP UPDATE

ICANN56 Policy Forum
Helsinki, 28 June 2016

High-level feedback on draft ICANN
FY17 Operating Plan and Budget
 Acknowledgement of improvements
 Need of more and/or clearer KPIs and timeframes
 Acknowledgement of inconsistencies regarding the
content-style across the Plan

 Recommendation for a more prudent approach to
expenses
 Invitation to a more careful assessment of the impact of
the IANA transition and accountability processes

Planning process
 Satisfaction for the planning process refinement
 Welcome the maintenance of the same plan structure in
the past years

 Calls with the community for a better understanding of
the input
 Very much welcome the expansion of the ccNSO-SOP
interaction with ICANN staff in charge of submitting the
content to Finance (session this afternoon)

Some elements to be further
discussed/elaborated by ICANN
 Reserve fund
 ICANN office/hub strategy
 Staffing and remuneration policies
 Monitoring tools and indexes (e.g. the Technical
Reputation Index and the Domain Market Place Health
Index)

Looking at ICANN feedback
 Generally OK, but sometimes circumnavigating the
precise answer to a precise question

 Commitment of ICANN staff to refine the Consolidated
FY17 Plan and include revised calculations, more
detailed information, planned activities, more cost
estimates, updates to reflect the development of the PTI
planning, …
 Monitoring tools and indexes (e.g. the Technical
Reputation Index and the Domain Market Place Health
Index)

Looking at ICANN feedback
 Need to define guidelines for multiyear projects
 Assessment of risk and opportunities
 ccNSO SOP should highlight specific areas of expense
increases that are seen as valuable (from another
stakeholder comment)
 Acknowledgement of the need to introduce more
benchmarks
