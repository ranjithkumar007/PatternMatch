Project Background
This Policy Development Process (PDP) was initiated to develop policy
recommendations for the provision of protection for identifiers of certain
International Governmental Organizations (IGOs) and International NonGovernmental Organizations (INGOs), including the Red Cross/Red Crescent
Movement (RCRC) and the International Olympic Committee (IOC).
The PDP Working Group completed its work in November 2013 and its
consensus recommendations were approved by the GNSO Council. In April
2014, the ICANN Board adopted those of the PDP recommendations that were
“not inconsistent” with GAC advice received on the topic, and requested more
time to consider the remaining, inconsistent recommendations.
The adopted recommendations relate to protection at the top and second
level for specific RCRC, IOC and IGO names (with an Exception Procedure to be
designed for the affected organizations), and a 90-days Claims Notification
process at the second level for certain INGO acronyms.

RCRC

Reserve Full Names of Red Cross, Red
Crescent, Red Crystal, Red Lion & Sun at
Top and Second levels in the 6 UN

189 National RC Societies: permanent
protection vs 90-days claims only?
Full name only vs acronyms also for
ICRC and IFRC, etc?

Design approach in consideration

Coordinate and collaborate with UNDESA as the ECOSOC authority
UNDESA provides ECOSOC list with Contact Data to ICANN
ICANN does not evaluate or adjust the ECOSOC list; use the list exactly
as received
ICANN produces DNS labels using the same algorithm used for existing
Spec. 5 Reserved Names List
If the length of any label produced by the algorithm is not between 1
and 63, there is no resulting label
The list and data are bulk loaded to the Claims System
A notice similar to the TMCH notices will be provided
New entries to ECOSOC list can only be made through UNDESA as the
list authority
UNDESA provides an updated ECOSOC list to ICANN on an annual
basis per UNDES update cycle
ICANN updates the Claims System with each update from UNDESA
