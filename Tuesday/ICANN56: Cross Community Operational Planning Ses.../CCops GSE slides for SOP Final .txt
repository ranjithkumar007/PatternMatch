ICANN Engagement
SUMMARY PRESENTATION
Cross-Community Session | Helsinki | 28 June 2016

Our engagement approach
• Our engagement mission: To work with our stakeholders around the world
making everyone affected by ICANN’s work aware of their rights and
responsibilities and of how they can engage with the issues and policies that affect
their future.
• This takes on increased importance in the era of the IANA stewardship transition, as
ICANN must ensure its decisions and actions include “broad, informed participation
reflecting the functional, geographic, and cultural diversity of the Internet at all levels
of policy development and decision-making.”

How Engagement is Structured
•

Global Engagement is rooted in the early days of ICANN’s formation, when it was
called Global Partnerships. This team had the difficult task of carrying ICANN’s
message with limited resources and staff. As awareness of ICANN has grown along
with the need to increase the diverse stakeholder community supporting its activities,
ICANN’s engagement function has become more representative of the global Internet
community.

•

Engagement is handled cross-functionally by ICANN’s community-facing teams:
Global Stakeholder Engagement (GSE), Government Engagement (GE), GDD, Policy
Development Support, Communications, Office of the CTO & Multistakeholder
Strategy and Strategic Initiatives.

•

Operating from ICANN’s hubs and engagement centers throughout the regions,
ICANN’s GSE team is structured into regional and functional teams.

How Engagement is Structured
•

The GSE team supports community-driven regional strategies in Africa, Asia Pacific,
Latin America and the Caribbean, the Middle East and Oceania regions (with plans in
development for Eastern Europe/Central Asia and sub-regional strategic plans in
Europe).

•

In addition, each Regional Vice President has a strategic work plan detailing key
stakeholder relationships, interactions and activities by Fiscal Year. There are also
functional area strategic plans for civil society engagement, global business
engagement and technical community engagement.

•

Engagement offices have been placed to serve the needs of our stakeholders. For
example, the LAC engagement office was opened at the Casa de Internet in
Montevideo. The Nairobi engagement office was opened after years of demand from
the community in Africa.
