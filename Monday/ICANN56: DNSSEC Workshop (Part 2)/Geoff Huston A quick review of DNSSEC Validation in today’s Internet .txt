A quick review of
DNSSEC Validation
in today’s Internet
Geoff	Huston

June	2016

What is being measured?
• Clients	who	will	perform	DNSSEC	validation	of	
a	domain	name
– Using	RSA/SHA-1	as	the	crypto	algorithm
– Who	will	not	resolve	a	badly-signed	domain	name

• We	are	NOT	measuring:
– Validating	resolvers
– Signed	domains

Some have been Validating
for many years

Sweden	– 80	%

Estonia	– 60	%

Comcast	– 90%

Romania	– 45	%

Recent DNSSEC Validation
Claro,	BR	– 90%

Faroe	Islands	- 90%

ICENET,	IS	– 90%

New	Zealand	- 50%

The Bigger Picture
• Much	of	the	African	continent	and	parts	of	Asia	
still	show	high	DNSSEC	validation	rates	due	to	
their	use	of	Google’s	Public	DNS	service	(which	
currently	receives	12%	of	the	Internet’s	query	
load)
• Comcast	resolvers	are	a	major	validation	system	
in	North	America	and	this	resolver	collection	
performs	the	second	highest	volume	of	validation
• Recent	areas	of	switching	on	DNSSEC	validation	in	
DNS	resolvers	are	in	Iceland,	Norway,	Brazil,	
Nepal,	New	Zealand	and	Papua	New	Guinea

But
• Growth	of	validation	deployment	has	slowed
– 80% of	all	current	queries	request	DNSSEC	
credentials
– 26% of	all	current	queries	perform	DNSSEC	
validation
– 11% of	current	queries	turn	to	a	non-validating	
resolver	upon	SERVFAIL
– 15% of	current	queries	will	perform	validation	and	
live	with	the	outcome

Thanks!
