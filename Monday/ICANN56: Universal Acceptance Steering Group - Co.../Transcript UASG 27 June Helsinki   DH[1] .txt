Ram Mohan:

Welcome, good afternoon, good day to wherever you are. We’re here in
lovely Helsinki. And we’re at the workshop on universal acceptance. This is
the UASG, the Universal Acceptance Steering Group. My name is Ram
Mohan. I’m the chair of the steering group. And it’s wonderful to see not only
a good group here, but a diverse group with representation from not only
different parts of industry, but also from different parts of the world.
The issue of universal acceptance itself is at straightforward issue. But the
problem that is straightforward, the solution set seems to not be as
straightforward, which is fairly common thing in technology, right?
I wanted to start off with a little bit of a personal story myself and share with
you, especially for those of you who haven’t heard this before, my own
induction, if you will, into universal acceptance. In 2001 the company I work
for, Afilias, was awarded the dotInfo top level domain. And we were very
excited that we had the first new gTLD that we were going to bring out into

the world. We had an excellent launch and we considered the fact that there
were many people who registered domain names by itself, to be a success.
And shortly thereafter, measured in the space of weeks, my phone started to
ring with people who had registered domain names complaining that they
were unable to use them. And, when I was asking, what do you mean unable
to use? They were giving me some really interesting examples. There was
one person who told me they were trying to register for an account on a
Website, and the account asked for their email address to send a
confirmation.
They put in their email address as dotInfo and the Website said, we don’t
recognize this; this is not a valid name. And there was nothing they could do.
And they had to default to some other address that they had. I thought that
was just a one-off. But soon my – not only did we end up getting phone calls
but our customer support line started to get inundated. And it became more
than just websites that were not accepting it. We also learned that emails that
were being sent with that dotInfo address were simply disappearing. It was
potentially reaching ISPs and then it just died. It dropped and it was just put
into the bucket.
A little bit of digging found that some ISPs had configured their systems to
say what an acceptable top level domain was and it was just a clear
definition. It had to be either three or two characters in length and it had to be
only in ASCII.
Now that as my own personal story getting into it. And the biggest problem
that I had actually at that time was trying to get anybody on the other side to
do anything about it. Reaching someone, being able to reach someone at
Yahoo or trying to reach someone at a bank or trying to reach someone at an
email provider was an incredibly difficult task, and I ended up eventually, we
were a four-person company at that time, I ended up creating the office of the
CTO. And I ended up writing letters on letterhead, we didn’t have a

ICANN

Page 3

letterhead, I had to build one. Built a letterhead and put a letter in, signed it,
put into a FedEx envelope and sent it to the office of the CTO of these big
companies and then it got opened and then I did get calls back because it
looked real, looked legitimate, right.
Now it doesn’t really scale. And on a global basis that kind of a model doesn’t
work. So that’s a personal story. But the real idea is this problem from 2000
and that kind of got exposed in 2001, has become far more exacerbated with
the growth of the Internet, with the growth of operating systems, and
applications and mobile devices. And perhaps it has been brought to the
greatest light with the expansion of new IDNs, with all of the thousand plus
new TLDs that have come in.
The world has changed. A valid domain name is no longer a domain name
that is three characters or two characters long. A valid domain name is no
longer a domain name that is in ASCII. And a valid email is no longer an
email that has just something at something dot ASCII either. In fact, a valid
email is now – it could be IDN, it could be internationalized all the way,
including to the left of the “at” symbol. And how does that work? How does it
get accepted? Is a part of the issue and a part of the problem set that we are
– we’re looking to solve.
So a year and a half ago a community effort developed. We spoke with
several folks. And what became very clear very quickly was that this was a
real problem, a real issue. And so we kind of self-gathered. We got together
at a meeting and there was a groundswell of support to build kind of a group
that would focus on universal acceptance, and focus especially on three
things.
First, to clearly define the nature of the problem, because that was not well
defined before. So that was a very important thing. The second thing was to
understand and define the targets to whom we had to go and approach.
Because in some cases, this is a technical problem that should just be solved

by technologists. In other cases, this is really an advocacy and a
management problem that has to reach the C levels of corporations and C
levels of organizations everywhere, right? So that was the second big focus.
The third was to look at where the current set of standards and protocols and
where things stand. And to, at the very least, shine a light on where gaps
exist and try to find a way to bridge those gaps. So if you look at the mission,
if you will, of the UASG, that’s really the – what we’re looking to do. We have
been fortunate that ICANN has provided the funding for this effort to take
place and to get going.
This is – UASG is not an ICANN body, it’s not an ICANN organization. This is
a community that comes together and a community that is trying to move
everything together. We also shifted our model. In the first nine months or so
when we started up UASG, our idea was we had a lot of enthusiasm. And our
idea was let’s get the volunteers to do all of the work. Let’s get the volunteers
to do all of the definitions and all of the targeting and direction and things like
that.
And it soon transpired that our aspirations were far ahead of our available
time for the volunteers. So we changed the model and the model for the
UASG now is that the volunteers provide guidance and direction and provide
the overall framework for what are the tasks, and what are the kind of
timelines that we would like to see achieved.
That is done in an open manner. There is a UASG email list and all of these
decisions and all of these kinds of things are brought up on the mail list. And
then the UASG really turns to the staff of the UASG to make sure that work
gets done.
And the prime mover of that is Don Hollander. Over to you, Don.

Don Hollander:

Thanks very much, Ram. So we’ll just go through a slide deck. I’ve only got
about 180 slides so we’ll be done in about 15 minutes. So this is a bit of what
the program is supposed to look like and we’ll see how it comes out today.
So we have an introduction from Ram. I’ll talk about activities since
Marrakech. Andrew Robertson, who’s going to join us from London, is going
to talk about our communications plans. That’s our current working activity
that we’re hoping to get sorted soon. Tony is going to talk about an event that
he was at Buenos Aires. Christian is going to talk about an event that he was
at in Philadelphia. Ashwin is going to give what is now turning into a bit of a
tradition, watching the progress of ICANN IT as a real-world exemplar of
making UA happen.
Then Frank Michlick will speak from Canada, you know, but fingers crossed
about the current status of a review of browsers. So one of the things we
wanted to look at over time was how core applications performed and
morphed as they became more and more UA ready. And browsers is one of
the categories that we’re working on.
I’ll talk about the budget for next year as well as the financials for this year.
And then we’ll have questions. And the second to the last item there is a new
Website being launched; we’re not going to cut ribbons but there is chocolate
to celebrate if you want to go to UASG.tech, that Website is now live.
So next slide.
Thanks. So one of the core issues is who are we trying to address? And Ram
pointed out that we have of core bits, first of all, what does universal
acceptance mean? And then who are we trying to address with our efforts?
And this is my simple clear – I think clear view is we want to target the people
who make these things happen. And that’s the system architects, developers,
consultants and contracting firms.

ICANN

Then we want to focus on the people who can direct that group to make it
happen, generally CIOs. And then the people who can influence the CIOs to
make these things happen and that’s their colleagues in the C-suite, board
members, government officials, ministers, consultants, media, and industry
influencers.
Next. So what we’ve done recently, and what we’re doing fundamentally is
we’ve got the foundation documents built. Those were in final draft, many of
them were in final draft in Marrakech. Well they've been finished and
published. We’re building industry-readiness. We’re building an EAI
community. And for those who don’t know, EAI is email address
internationalization which is effectively non-ASCII characters to the left or the
right of the “at” sign. Harder than you think.
We’re looking to build measures so we can see whether we’re making any
progress, building an outreach strategy. And Andrew is going to talk about
that in detail. And start building some pilots. So next slide. Thanks.
So and next again.
So what I’m hoping we’ll achieve out of this is everybody will get an
understanding of what's happening in universal acceptance and what the
UASG is going. And we would be keen for people to commit to local UA
initiatives in your own hometown. And we’re seeing some of that already. And
we’re keen to accelerate that some more. Next.
Thanks. So this is our concise view of what universal acceptance is. It’s being
able to accept, validate, store, process and display domain names and data
that has domain names in it correctly and consistently by all Internet-enabled
applications, devices and systems.

So what we're doing – next thanks – so we’re creating documentation, mostly
technical, I’ll go through some of that, creating some test cases, fixing
programming languages, establishing some baseline measures,
(unintelligible) some cooperation and reaching out. Next.
Thanks. So in terms of the organization structure Ram talked about that and
we had a meeting in January and there was, to be fair, I think a reasonable
amount of frustration around the table and we switched the way we did things
on its head.
And that’s possibly made a big difference to what’s been achieved in the past
few months to what was achieved in the past year. But to be fair, the first year
was a lot of trying to figure out where we were and what we needed to do and
who might do things.
Programming language, so talked about that already. Next.
Thanks. So this is the universal acceptance steering group so Ram Mohan
introduced himself already as the chair. WE have Christian Dawson in the
room. Edmon is in the room. Raise your hand. Thank you, Edmon. And Rich
Merdinger is in the room as well. So they were the folks who volunteered at
the beginning to take these leadership roles to make – get things kicked off.
And I’ve taken the role of emperor du jour, or secretary general. And we
shifted, as I said, the way we're doing things.
We started last year with four project groups and we’ve refined that to having
two project groups. One is community outreach and the other is EAI. And we
want to acknowledge very much the strong support that we get from ICANN.
So we see ourselves as a community group supported by ICANN, not an
ICANN group. But we are really grateful for the support we get from ICANN.
And it’s not just money but the time and effort of the ICANN staff who are
keenly interested in this and the use of the ICANN administrative
infrastructure. So that’s very, very useful.

So I’d like to go now to the documentation that we’ve actually produced. And
I’ll go through this fairly quickly because I hope most people in this room will
know about it. If you don’t then you can go to UASG.tech and actually see the
documents. So we have UASG 001, a knowledge base. And we’ll look to be a
– expanding this. This is if you have a problem with your domain name or
TLD or whatever, who do you go to sort out browser issues or who do you go
to sort out LinkedIn issues or Skype issues or what’s that other thing, Twitter,
or what have you. There’s lots of things. We know about the first bits, so
Twitter is a little different.
We have revised our webmaster engagement note so if you encounter a
Website and you say it doesn’t accept, so we produced very simple two
paragraph note for you to send to the webmaster of that Website suggesting
that they might want to fix it. It’s very polite, very gentle. And it’s now in 14
languages thanks to the resources of the community.
We have a FAQ sheet, which is a one page look at what issues are from a
non-technical point of view. That’s currently in review so we published that
one in December last year and we’re looking at it again based on revised
communication strategy. We have UASG 004, these are use cases,
examples that people can use when they want to test their own systems and
that we’re using when we’re testing browsers and email systems. And this is
things like new.ascii short, new.ascii long, ascii.idn, IDN.ascii, IDN.idn,
Arabic.arabic. that sort of thing.
We have the quick guides, which are now available on a bunch of languages.
And I handed out earlier for people who wanted them, they're available in –
we have printed copies in English and in Spanish at the moment. And I think
we have a commitment to make them available in Hindi for the next meeting,
so I think that’ll be exciting. UASG 006 is a list of relevant RFCs. Next page.

And this is – I’m really delighted with this, not that I did any work, but Mark
from Microsoft did a huge amount of the work here. And that’s our
introduction to universal acceptance. This is aimed at the geeks, at the
developers. This is Mark’s text. And it’s a 40-page document that goes from
the assumption of no knowledge to a very clear and detailed explanation of
how all these things work, and items to consider as you decide how you’re
going to implement this within your community.
So and I’m really delighted with the approach that we took to developing that.
So we drafted it and then we had very – several very close readings with the
community both online and in the face to face. We have a model for local
engagement. We have a quick guide for contracts and tender documents.
These are just clauses that you might want to include in your commercial
agreements. And we’ve expanded this a little bit to include what (Leslie
Dagel) used to call broccoli issues so it’s universal acceptance, DNS SEC
and IPv6.
And then we have USAG 010, which is a quick guide to (linkification). Next.
Thanks. So going forward these are the – thanks – these are the projects that
we’re working on. Next.
Thanks. So programming languages, we’ve got four teams poised. They’ll be
working in parallel to look at very common open-source programming
languages, see what needs to be done to get there – to get the core
language framework UA-ready and to make those changes and then publish
them.
So that when somebody says, oh, well, this is written in PHP and I don’t want
to have to go and change these libraries, we’ll say, not a worry, we’ve got that
done for you already. And we’re expecting the first results of those available
by ICANN 57. Next.

Thanks. So EAI, for those who, you know, support email, is support for IDNs
and Unicode at domain names, we’re looking for test environments, we’re
looking to coordinate the large, very large email service and software
providers and identify implementation decisions. So while the RFCs cover
quite a lot of them, the necessary bits, there’s some decisions that the
developers need to make and we’re looking to coordinate that activity. Next.
So other stuff that we’re working on we’re preparing a white paper. This is
aimed at the CIO and C-star suite and it’s looking at the financial, social and
cultural benefits of making the investment in -making your systems universal
acceptance ready. We think that there’s a compelling financial reason that
people should make this decision because it’s not a costless exercise and so
we’ve commissioned the report that we expect to have available in about two
or two and a half months.
We’re using the IDG Executive Council to reach CIOs so those of you who
may not come from a CIO sort of space, IDG is one of the world’s most
prestigious and well-regarded think spots – thinking groups for IT issues and
a lot of CIOs will subscribe to their services of briefings and research
capabilities. So we’re going to work with them.
We’ve launched a dedicated Website and we’ve got great support, as I said,
from ICANN which includes collaboration with IT so the ICANN IT group not
just from Ashwin’s position of presenting things to us, he's also presenting
things to the software development communities around the world. And the
team -- his team -- is providing good contributions as well.
We’ve got articles in ICANN meeting newsletters, social media interaction
and there have been some brown bag lunches at the LA office on what
universal acceptance is. Thanks. Next.
So if we have Andrew on the line then he's going to talk through the next bits.
Andrew, are you there?

Andrew Robertson:
Don Hollander:

Yes, Don. I’m here.

We can hear you fine. Thank you, Andrew from Edelman. Thanks.

Andrew Robertson:

Good afternoon everybody in Helsinki. Can we have the next slide,

please? Hello. Hello, can you hear me?
Don Hollander:

Yes, we can hear you. Can you see the slides?

((Crosstalk))
Don Hollander:

…the slide that says Communication Strategy.

Andrew Robertson:
Don Hollander:

Okay.

Is that the slide you wanted?

Andrew Robertson:

Yes, I can’t – sorry, (unintelligible). Just one second. Yes, okay so

communication strategy, just to – so what we’ve done here, we’ve divided this
into two phases. And Phase 1 takes us – well we started a couple months
back and takes us to August. And Phase 2 will take us from September
through to March and a bit beyond.
And so Phase 1, what we’re aiming to do is educate on the issues,
commence initial engagement, and I’ll go into that in a bit more – in
subsequent slides. And this Phase 2 it’s broader engagement and engaging
advocates to help us get the message out there to take action and to be
prepared to take action on UA so, yeah, next slide please.
Great, thank you. So going in a bit more detail on Phase 1, which I’d
mentioned we’ve already kicked off, so working closely with the UASG,
Edelman, the company I work for, global communications firm, has developed

ICANN
Coordinator: Nathalie Peregrine
06-27-16/8:01 am CT
Confirmation #8995685
Page 12

a strategic communications plan and messaging and narrative document,
which I’ll go to in a bit more detail later in the presentation. And we’ve
developed a framework for social media, how we engage through social
media channels like Twitter and LinkedIn.
We’ve developed materials including and challenging question out for
documents, go into quite some detail. And we’ve developed materials for our
four engagement like an introductory letter for – and for reaching associations
– that’s technical associations. And we’ve prepared to engage via LinkedIn
groups with one of our social media platforms.
Specifically targeting CIO groups at present, as Don and Ram have both
mentioned, CIOs are critical – a critical audience for us. So we’re looking to
engage with LinkedIn groups to which CIOs belong.
Developing blog posts and case studies and testimonials. Just a little point on
that, just really quickly, we know that companies are in the very early stages
of implementing their UA strategies and it may not be possible to have case –
you know, fully developed case studies because people won’t have
completed their UA projects. But we are kicking off with testimonials to show
that – show that – demonstrate that large well-known companies and others
have actually engaging with this issue and taking action.
And again, another point of social media, we’re providing guidance on social
media and how we engage via – how we create Wikipedia entries or have
them created for us to inform on the issue.
And then we’ll be studying initial briefings. We’ve got some key priority media
that we’ve identified from the tech sector primarily at this point. And in other
influences such – and those would include technology sector analysts, for
example analysts that may work for firms like IDC or Gartner and industry
groups as well.

So to the next slide please. Thank you. And this is going into more detail,
again, Phase 2, which is – this is a broader engagement and advocacy
element of the project estimated to start in September. So developing
additional materials to support and provide tangible proof points on UA. And
those will include a white paper and hopefully we plan to develop video,
infographic material that will tell the story in a visual manner so it can be
easily understood and shared. We want to make this content sharable.
Blog posts, press releases, again, that refers back to our media engagement
strategy. And, yes, that’s the main elements of that. And so the outreach
we’re building on the main elements of the foundation that we establish in
Phase 1, and then that we’re engaging with broader UA experts to amplify
this message and drive awareness. So onto the next slide please.
Going back this is repeat of the slide that Don introduced earlier, just
reinforcing who we’re trying to reach here, the people that can make this
happen. So it’s developer audiences, it’s, you know, CIOs and it’s people who
can influence to make this happen at the C-suite, board level, government
officials and consultants and others.
So to the next slide please. Thank you. So part of – what we did as part of the
initial engagement with the UASG is held a workshop and developed a set of
really solid messaging. This was done collaboratively with the – quite a
number of members of the group. And went through several iterations, and
we ended up with a very concise – well a very detailed document that helps
us reach all of our key target audiences.
And we’ve just taken a couple of experts from this document to show how
we’ve condensed our messaging and what – and what we want to be saying
to this audience. So what we have here is an umbrella message. This is our
key top line message. So I don’t intend to read it out, you have that in front of
you. But it – that’s a concise take on one line – a one-liner on what we are
saying to – about UA and its importance.

ICANN
Coordinator: Nathalie Peregrine

Confirmation #8995685
Page 14

And on the next slide we had this backed up by supporting messages, and
then in the full document we go into more detail from here. But to explain
further what the purpose of this is, is to – it’s to help us – and help UASG
members during media interaction, for example, or other key indications, to
have a document that – one central document that we can use as a key
communications resource so that we’ve got really clear messaging and we’re
sticking with that messaging and that will hopefully translate into the resulting
– through the resulting media interviews and coverage and through social
media and other elements of the program.
So this – just briefly I won’t read this out again because you have it in front of
you. At the top key message there is all about UA and its role in being part of
getting the next billion Internet users online.
Author

The second message relates to why businesses have a responsibility to take
– to play a key role in UA and making this happen. And the third key
message is a rationale for UA designed to help CIOs in particular think about
why this is important. And what we’re saying is that UA leads to a better user
experience. So in the end it’s for the benefit of the end user which reflects,
you know, which is positive for the Website operator as well, obviously.
And to the next slide, please. Okay. So what you’re looking at here is the
timeline of activities that we – that – from now – from the Helsinki meeting
until the next ICANN meeting in India. And listed out there is, you know, what
we plan to do. And I believe the Website is actually gone live today, if I’m
correct there. I saw the message on that earlier. And these are the different
materials that we will have developed and tactics that we will have deployed
in Phase 1 and then leading into Phase 2 which we, as I said in one of the
earlier slides, kicks off in September.
Yeah, might be the next slide. Okay. What we want to really impress upon
people is how they can get involved in UA now that we’ve given you some

ICANN
Coordinator: Nathalie Peregrine
06-27-16/8:01 am CT
Confirmation #8995685
Page 15

information on what’s happening with the communication program. And what
we’ve broken this into three areas, we’d like you to think about in this way,
educate your – the companies, the people you work with, the people in your
professional circles on the importance of UA. And we’re providing the
materials for that.
So advocate with these same people and peers and find out how, you know,
you can be a voice in your communities. And then amplifying it through your
own social media networks and other channels, you know, via Twitter
handles and so forth, via your LinkedIn groups, yeah, via, you know,
Facebook professional groups that you may be a part of so that’s – I think
that’s what we’re hoping to help you do there.
So – and moving to the next slide, so a call to action here is to introduce UA
to your organizations via – and social media manager and your organization
social media manager to get your own organization UA ready particularly in
relation at this point to brand TLDs. And reach out to your local IT
organizations particularly regarding – in relation to geographical TLDs at this
point. And moving to the next slide, okay sorry, that was the end of that.
Ram Mohan:

Go back to the prior slide.

Andrew Robertson:
Ram Mohan:

Yes.

And let’s open it up for questions into Andrew. Okay let me take a minute and
speak just to the very first call to action. For those of you who work at larger
companies, one of the things that we struggle with is, you know, when we put
a tweet out or when we put a posting out or a video up on something to do
with universal acceptance, one of the big challenges is how do we amplify
that message, how do we get it out to a larger group?
And typically we have a hard time, you know, getting someone’s attention
from a larger organization to retweet it or to share a post that we have placed

ICANN
Coordinator: Nathalie Peregrine
06-27-16/8:01 am CT
Confirmation #8995685
Page 16

on LinkedIn or Facebook. So if we can get an introduction to who your social
media manager is then the team from Edelman has a lot of skills in being
able to speak with those social media manager to explain the mission of
UASG and to schedule, along with the social media managers, perhaps they
have an event that they are planning or perhaps they have something else
that they are doing to integrate the UA messaging as part of that
organization’s media messaging itself.
And I must tell you that without that introduction from you from the inside it’s a
pretty hard job to actually reach these social media managers because they
are the most popular people inside of their companies. Everybody wants
some of their time. Everybody wants them to retweet and share the posts.
Tony, you were going to say something?
Tony Harris:

Yes, could we rewind a couple of the slides? There was one with three bullet
points which were very important. That one. Referring to Bullet Point 2 there,

Author
Deleted: retweet

I think that is extremely important because basically what we’re saying there
is people should be aware that the Internet is being updated. I don’t think we
get that message out. We should be speaking about the Internet being
updated and everybody wants to be updated with the Internet. I would use
that. I mean, it’s said there not in the same words but that’s what it’s saying
there.

I’d even take that further and say, well, why don’t we look at the possibility of
certification, certification of UA compliance, some sort of seal of certificate
that can be – I mean, all the software organizations in the world would like to
handle that but with their members, because it gives them something to offer
their members and they can do a double check on whether this is a fact or
not.
I don’t think that should be too difficult or too expensive to organize. Just a
couple of thoughts.

Man:

(Unintelligible) the League of Arab States. I’m a member of the Arabic
Generation Panel too. Okay. I would suggest maybe you can make –
introduce a badge of UA readiness to be put on the sites which are UA ready.
So we can encourage the site admins to (unintelligible) and make it ready
more easily. You know.

Ram Mohan:

Thank you. I think that’s a great suggestion. Other comments? Cyrus.

Cyrus Namazi:

Thank you. Cyrus Namazi with ICANN staff. I guess to the same point that
Tony raised in the second point on the slide. Just by the show of hand, how
many of you run Websites that are UA ready or have active projects to make
it UA ready?

Cyrus Namazi:

Thank you. I guess I’m trying to emphasize that, you know, the work really
needs to begin in this room and then expand and amplify and go beyond.
Just wanted to reemphasize that.

Don Hollander:

So it’s Don here. With respect to UA certification, one of the questions is what
are the criteria for UA certification? And there’s a Chinese research institute
that is looking at this to encourage Chinese government organizations to

ICANN
Coordinator: Nathalie Peregrine

Page 18

become UA ready. And they are currently working on what the criteria they’re
going to use and some preliminary – some preliminary measures. So we’re
hoping that we’ll get an update from them at the ICANN India meeting of the
work that they are doing, the criteria that they’re coming up with. And we’ll
work together with them as we can to expand it outside of the Chinese
government.
Edmon Chung:

Edmon Chung here. Speaking on what Don said and the calls for action, I’ve
repeated this many times, and kind of sounding like a broken record, but still
it’s important, you know, as we call out a lot of times when companies look at
the issue it seems very trivial at first. The – to actually make it UA ready. It’s
not hard, it’s just very – it entails a lot more because every single piece of
software almost uses domain names or email addresses one way or the
other.
And that’s the whole spectrum of systems and platforms. And when they tried
– when they work together within your company that’s what creates the
complexity. The changing, you know, making a particular browser, a
particular system UA ready is usually not the main challenge, it’s making the
entire suite of software that you use internally that makes it much more
difficult. And I guess that’s what ICANN will share a lot more. And that’s also
reason why the call for action is really to get people to start looking at it.
I don’t think we can expect websites or companies to be UA ready
immediately. In fact, it’s almost impossible as ICANN’s experience will show.
But it’s time to, you know, get a roadmap and get a little bit of timetable out.
And that’s really the call for action I think right now.

Ram Mohan:

Rich.

Rich Merdinger:

Thank you, Ram. Rich Merdinger with Go Daddy. And piling on with what
Edmon was suggesting, as we do look to integrate universal acceptance
concepts into our systems ourselves, those of you that haven’t done so yet,

please take a look at the materials that are found on the Website and see if
they are informative and informational and actually useful in doing so
because if it isn’t making it easier to do it we need to do these materials
differently. Thank you.
Ram Mohan:

Thank you. Could we bring us back to the call to action slide? I just want that
to be there while we have the conversation. Other thoughts? Any thoughts
from those who are working on brand TLDs or geo TLDs? Does this call to
action sound relevant to you?

Rich Merdinger:

Rich Merdinger, Go Daddy again. Yes, we have dotGodaddy that’s coming
towards delegation and definitely is.

Ram Mohan:

Thank you. Thank you, Andrew. Back to you, Don.

Don Hollander:

Thanks very much. Next slide. And the next slide. So Tony is going to talk
about a recent event in Buenos Aires.

Tony Harris:

Yes, okay. Tony Harris here again. First of all, who are these people we did
the event with. Their name is Sysarmy. That’s S-Y-S Army. That’s the way it’s
written, believe it or not. Sysarmy is the Argentinian sys admin community
who brings together all IT professionals for knowledge exchange and fun.
This is how they define themselves.
They have an annual event, which thanks to Don – Don’s cooperation and
interest, we were able to sponsor. And I had a table there which was actually

Deleted: corporation

was a CABASE table, the organization I work for, but we gave out brochures.
You’ve got the brochures I brought for you. The quick guide, I’m sorry, the
quick guide for the universal acceptance. We had that printed in Spanish.
And we were giving these out at a table.
To give you an idea what this event consisted of, the hall where I had the
table was surrounded by, I don’t know, maybe 30, 40 large tables where all

Author
Deleted: (unintelligible)

ICANN
Coordinator: Nathalie Peregrine
06-27-16/8:01 am CT
Confirmation #8995685
Page 20

these IT professionals or, you know, systems managers, they were all sitting
around running – trying out new software and solving problems amongst
themselves. It was hard to get their attention. But they were all there.
And in another hall they were having technical talks, the people were giving
them different talks about new technologies, new software, and thanks to the
cooperation of Microsoft, Mark here was able to have one of his people in
Argentina come over and give a brief talk on universal acceptance from a
technical point of view. I’m not a technical person so it was great to have this
guy there. Thank you very much for that. And of course the name of Microsoft
also helps for people to pay attention.
I think the main takeaway from this is these people are interested in
continuing to work with ICANN. And, I mean, there were only probably 300 or
400 people showed up there. But their networks consist of 6000. So they’re
open to see how we can – how we would like to outreach through their
system, through their regular getting together and discussing things, how we
can continue this with their group. And they also have contact with other
groups in other countries.
So I think this is, let’s say, a small goldmine we found, which if we progress it,
it’s very technical, you have to interest them technically. Otherwise they won’t
even bother to listen. So I think this is just one good opportunity. I’d like to
mention something else that happened, which didn’t happen in Argentina.
Before this event, I was in Sao Paulo on an outreach event which (Rodrigo),
who’s sitting here from ICANN, was kind enough to organize, and it was a
booth in (unintelligible) event, which was an event of Brazilian ISPs. There
were 3000 ISPs there. Believe me, they were all there. You couldn’t walk in
the halls.
And we had an ICANN booth, which was tailored to the ISPCP constituency,
and I talked to a lot of people about universal acceptance, and I also gave a

Author
Deleted: corporation

ICANN
Coordinator: Nathalie Peregrine
06-27-16/8:01 am CT
Confirmation #8995685
Page 21

talk on ICANN to ISPs. And this was part of the presentation, which I did
universal acceptance, again, not from a technical perspective because I’m a
marketing guy, not a technician.
But there was one very interesting comment from – which I think is important
we should pay attention to from a Brazilian ISP who timidly raised his hand
and said, this is extremely interesting, have you considered implementing a
repository of problem instances for targeted remedial action? In other words,
where you know of complaints, specific complaints that come up and are
flagged perhaps the registry flags them or an ISP or whatever. Do they go
anywhere? And does anybody look at them and then go after solving them?
Because that’s telling you where you have a problem, right?
I think we did mention this in previous events. But it was interesting that
somebody from the audience came up with this. It wasn’t me sort of repeating
myself. So that’s what I have to say right now about this. But I think this is
sort of group is very interesting because there really – they’re all techies and
this sort of thing they love to solve problems. That’s what they get together
for.
Don Hollander:

So thanks, Tony. So this was our first go at sponsoring an event. Was it worth
the effort do you think? We have another opportunity in Brazil shortly.

Tony Harris:

I think it was more than worth the effort. And as I say, I think it’s a door
opener. The event themselves gets you into the organization, if you – you
give them a hand, you sponsor them. They don’t have much money to do
these things. Once you’re in there then you can follow through and you get to
all these people. I mean, it’s a really good opportunity.

Ram Mohan:

This is Ram. It sounds to me that if we can – this is kind of a pilot model but if
we can figure this out and do it in an effective way then we might have
something that is replicable in multiple parts of the world, which is really
eventually where we have to go because it seems like this would provide a

ICANN
Coordinator: Nathalie Peregrine

Confirmation #8995685
Page 22

feeder for the outreach and the materials and the technical documents and
other things like that. It’d be a good feeder, right, for them.
One question I had, Tony, is our focus primarily, especially the technical
documents, has been to just write them and it stays in English. Is that an
impediment or does it not matter?
Tony Harris:

All these people speak English. And I might also, well, since I have the mic I
would make a final suggestion, I’d like to get the person who’s leading this
and who coordinated this with us I’d like to put him in contact with whoever
you decide so then you can follow through on a technical to technical basis.
And I think that will be more productive and me get out of the way at this
point.

Ram Mohan:

That’s a terrific idea. And I volunteer Don for it.

Tony Harris:

Who should – okay.

Don Hollander:

Thanks very much, Tony. Any other questions for Tony? Next slide then.

Christian Dawson:

And that is because M3AAWG is a group of network operators that are
focused on anti-abuse. And the reason that I think it’s very important to

Author
Deleted: M3AAG

engage those individuals is first of all, they have the ability to actually make
things – make things move on universal acceptance. The issue at hand being
that most of the messaging that I hear coming from that community is
focused on abuse problems that are being seen out of new gTLDs.
And what happens when you don’t – we don’t need to engage on those terms
and have those conversations. But what happens when you don’t engage
them on the terms of the kind of conversations we’re trying to have, that’s the
only messaging that people end up hearing.
And when that’s the case it ends up being sort of a – though it is not a direct
counter-message to what it is we’re doing because they’re not going to
actually come in and shake their finger and tell us that we’re wrong, when
people go to prioritize, how they, again, upgrade the Internet, they’re going to
take a look at the messaging coming out of places like M3AAWG and say
well there are pros and there are cons to actually moving forward on this and
they’ll decide to de-prioritize these efforts.

So I wanted to go in there and start having these conversations with
M3AAWG from the very beginning. And I’m very excited about the
conversation that we ended up having. My organization – I2 Coalition, was

Author

granted four sessions and three workshops that we got to program at
M3AAWG. And we made one of them a universal acceptance-focused
session.

Author
Deleted: M3AAG

And I think we did it in a very interesting way that allowed us to workshop a
couple of things that we’ve wanted to workshop. The first is that the focus of
the – the focus of the engagement was “eat your vegetables”. It was focused
not only UA though UA got the primary focus, but also on DNSSEC and IPv6.

And so we took a holistic view as to how people should upgrade the Internet.
And we saw how that resonated. The other thing is the actual format was a

Author

Q&A with our own Ram Mohan right next to me. And that’s great because
Ram is great and he's a great presenter, but also because I think the way that
we were approaching that it’s a good framework for how we intend to engage
CIOs because it was basically peers talking to peers about the importance of
what it is they should focus on.
And so as we were talking about what Edelman has presented to us, about
engaging CIOs, I think that you basically gave a good framework to do that
kind of messaging there at M3AAWG. So I was extremely excited about how
it went.

got about 1/5 of them in the room to see our presentation, which is, you

know, it’s over 100 people of very targeted – in a very targeted audience. And
so that was very useful.
I’m going to end up at our next organizers meeting re-approaching the idea of
this organization becoming a member of M3AAWG. The last time we brought
it up what we saw was well, you know what, I2 Coalition is a member of

Author

M3AAWG, many of the companies that are at the table like Go Daddy are
members of M3AAWG, (ECO) is a member of M3AAWG and ICANN is a

there are so many M3AAWG memberships already at the table?

found, through that engagement, that it’s a worthy conversation to continue to

Rich Merdinger:

Yes, I’d like to make a comment regarding UASG becoming a member of
M3AAWG. And I’m not a M3AAWG fanatic by any means, but back when we
decided early on to belay that idea for a while, that’s back when these people
that are at the table whose organizations are members of M3AAWG, we’re
attempting to do the work so we already had UASG active representation
able to go to M3AAWG.

Now that we are in coordination role, I think it’s more important that the
organization itself be a member so that it can be doing the work for itself that
way. So I think there’s a difference in the way we’re structured and that has
changed my approach to it, and I’m in favor of it for what it’s worth.
Christian Dawson:

I think that’s – I was for it then but I think that I was for it then. I think that
you’re right, it does make more sense now in our current – thank you.

Ram Mohan:

Thanks.

Barry Leiba:

This is Barry Leiba. I’m the IETF liaison to M3AAWG. So – I couldn’t be in the
session in Philadelphia because I had a conflict, I had to be somewhere else,

happy to do I don’t know, whatever back and forth might help there too. So

Christian Dawson:
Ram Mohan:

Thank you. Definitely will.
Other comments? I wanted to share just a couple of observations from being
at this event. Some of the questions that came there was – we were using the
example of Citi Bank and we were using the example of, you know,
dotCitibank and its acceptance. And it was unplanned but it turned out that in
the audience there were two people from Citi Bank who came up to the
microphone and said why are you talking about us this way? And we ended
up saying, “Do you have a universal acceptance project underway?”

And they were saying, well, we need more information. So I think to me,
anyway, that was anecdotally some level of evidence that there is value in
engaging with this group and being a part of this group.
Okay. Back to you, Don.
Don Hollander:

And now back to Ashwin. So while we get his slides up, Ashwin has been
very – first of all, phenomenally supportive of the project. But he agreed a
long time ago, I think in Buenos Aires, that he would – he would give us a
regular update. And probably the – apart from the last slide, it’s probably –
everybody’s favorite part of the session because you give us a real world
view as to what do you have to do be UA ready.
So, Ashwin, thank you very much.

Ashwin Rangan: Don, thank you. Appreciate it. This is the continuing saga of ICANN getting to
UA compliance. So next slide please. I’m going to be touching on a few
different agenda topics here. Not knowing exactly how much experience
people have with what we are talking about at the definitional level, there are
a few slides that I’ll go through quickly that talk to definitions and what it
means to be UA compliant.
Then we’ll talk about our own project and our experiences in modifying
custom applications and trying to get UA compliance from those vendors who
are partnering with us and providing us with package solutions. And then I’ll
give you a status and some guidance on where you can find more
information. Next slide, please.
Overall definitions, for those that have been dealing with it, it’s a fairly long list
that have gotten developed over time as the nuances have been further and
further refined. Next slide please.

ICANN
Coordinator: Nathalie Peregrine
06-27-16/8:01 am CT

But fundamentally it comes down to five criteria that now have been codified
in the form of the how to guide here. It’s accepting whatever comes toward
you from whatever source it may be. It could be a user interface, it could be
another application sending a parameter or it could be from a file validating
and in the validation step is where things like IDN left or right, right to left,
those nuances really become important, whether it’s at the TLD or the SLD
state.
GTLDs provide a whole bunch of those challenges. Storing, the length and
direction and character set. Next slide please. Processing is an interesting
challenge, we’re discovering more and more. We are able to retrieve what we
have stored and then when we tell the processor to understand what it is that
it’s processing, it can be quite challenging especially when it comes to
directionality and IDNs.
Special character requirements, the tilde at the top of the N was an
interesting one. We found that whether it’s on top or whether it follows it’s
treated the same way. And in different languages it has different
connotations. So that’s an interesting kind of corner case that we’ve hit there.
And displaying of course, displaying it in the proper character set, whatever
that may be. Next slide, please.
We took an approach of kick starting this by making it into a project. We
talked quite a bit about coming to this particular meeting with possible code
snippets so that we could have something to show. In fact, I think it was
Edmon who challenged us to bring that back. And I said, yes, I can pick that
gauntlet up and I’ll see what we can do. So we did that. And to do that in
ICANN it means we do two things.
One, we prioritize an effort as a project, very differently from just a low level
low hum kind of a project, or an activity, if you will. And secondly, it means
that there is a conscious redistribution of resources. We take stuff away from
other things to put on these projects. But to get it kick started, we thought that

ICANN
Coordinator: Nathalie Peregrine
06-27-16/8:01 am CT
Confirmation #8995685
Page 28

this would be a good thing to do. So we defined the project charter, and
assigned out roles and responsibilities, scheduled kick off meetings, assigned
accountability to different people and said let’s get a few things going. Next
slide please.
And very deliberately, we selected one application per environment so that
we would have different learnings. Potentially different approaches because
we would be using different talent sets from different skill groups. Through
that, there was the potential to discover smarter ways to approach this
problem set and coming back together. So we hired it off into different – in
different directions, and asked our teams to go figure out with the guidance
that we provided them how to make their specific application in their specific
environment UA compliant.
We also decided that everything else that wasn’t in the first slew of projects or
the first slew in the first project, would be, you know, we would prioritize a list
but not by environment, more by the importance of the application itself. And
work through the list updating estimates as we got to learn more from the first
project.
In the course of doing that, we obviously knew that we would get some
intelligence built into our code libraries. One of the thoughts that we have is to
update an open source library with code snippets that we find or we create to
deal with UA compliance issues.
Next slide please. So in modifying an application, it’s a three step tango. You
find it, you fix it and you test it. You can’t fix it unless you know where to go fix
it. So you got to find it first. So there has to be some means through which
you find all the instances in a given application that need to be looked at,
fixed and then tested.
Obvious things link-checkers, etcetera you can find a lot of things. Some
report all links; some report only the broken links so depends on what you’re

Author

ICANN
Coordinator: Nathalie Peregrine

Confirmation #8995685
Page 29

picking. One of the things that we learned early on is that in many
applications the login name is an email ID. And it’s often time overlooked.
You fix everything else but if you can’t get into the application then you’re not
UA compliant.
So that’s a sort of “oops, got you”. We saw that in one application early on
and then we said, okay, add this to the checklist as one of the things that
you’ve got to do right up front. Environment library is not all of them
understand Unicode. So that was – oh, well, we have an issue here don’t we?
Right? Next slide please.
Fixing it, it’s all the five criteria that I talked about, the accept, validate, store,
retrieve process and then display. In the accepting we now know the rules of
how long these can be in the TLD and the SLDs. We know that, you know,
we talked in prior meetings about Unicode, Punycode and ASCII. With
validation, the UASG guide says don’t essentially don’t do the download and
lookup validation or if you have to do that then download frequently because
that’s a dynamic list at this point in time.
So we’ve gone down both pathways. We’ve looked at a bunch of different
variables in making this happen. Storing – we hit a cybersecurity kind of an
issue when the element size was not checked. There is a size overflow and
that could be – it could be an entry point if you’re not careful. So when we
were going through our testing is when we discovered that. And said, okay,
build that into our stories so that that’s a check that’s done up front.
It’s a restore point that that that happens, it’s an overflow, and if it’s not
looked at carefully then the overflow occurs, and you leave yourself a hole in
the backend. Next slide please.
Process, this is probably the area where the most thought and work and
feedback has been for our teams and between our teams. Lots of different
things were discovered. I’ve listed out the major things that we sort of came

together on, special character, I talked about the (unintelligible) on top of the
N, that’s in different language sets that’s a different connotation. It’s
something to be looked out for. I’m not sure how many of those particular
(unintelligible) following the character will be used in the creation of TLDs as
we go into the future but in certain language sets the tilde is a very important
character so it needs special attention in that regard.
Christian Dawson:

To clarify that, you’re actually – are you actually talking about a regular
tilde character, not a combining tilde.

Ashwin Rangan: That is correct.
Christian Dawson:

Okay.

Ashwin Rangan: That is correct, a regular tilde character, yes. Next slide please. So, Edwin,
here we are. We’ve got a java example of what it was before and what it is
after. These are example sets that are part of the presentation here and at
some point we’ll be posting this up into (GitHub) so that it becomes available
for anyone in the world to look at, pull down and reuse at it makes sense.

Next slide, please.
Testing. We had a code tester be developed for us by a company that does
software development on our behalf. So we’re able to use that very quickly
now as we get to code compliance, run it through the checker and get back
immediate results on what makes sense, what doesn’t make sense.

The UASG has also created test emails. We use those too. We essentially
tried to use as many resources as possible in the test phase so that what we
do is done once and done once and for all so that we don’t have to go back
and revisit. Next slide please. Next slide.
More examples - with packaged products and services our treatment for off
the shelf products go through a series of questions as the questions of the

ICANN
Coordinator: Nathalie Peregrine
06-27-16/8:01 am CT
Confirmation #8995685
Page 31

counterparty and make sure that if there is a contractual obligation which
there typically is, you do not only UA compliance but also look at IPv6 and
DNS SEC at the same time. If you’re going to back to a contract, it’s a good
time to combine all of those together. And as an example last time I shared
the kind of T's and C's we have in our contracts with this team.
We’ve included that in the presentation so if there is an interest you can pull
that down and take it to your legal teams and modify it as necessary. Next
slide please.
So the good news from our viewpoint, we started out with our entire portfolio
and divided that up into what’s off the shelf and which ones are custom. And
then we parsed it to look at what needed to be worked and which ones were
not requiring any UA compliance work at all. In the off the shelf area with one
we now have UA compliance. And we’ve learned a great deal from getting
that particular vendor to play nice with us, what are all the likely hurdles that
we go through. It’s a simple application but it’s taught us a great deal
disproportionately large in terms of lessons learned.
With custom code, as I said, our first project was across multiple platforms
with that we now have eight different services that re UA compliant so we’ve
made, in my view, fairly dramatic progress in a short period of time. But as we
move into the future, our next projects will be as and when we open code as
opposed to a concerted thrust just to open code and learn more about UA
compliance. Next slide please.
And this is the last slide. This is a bunch of resources that anyone can look
at. One of the things that my team and I are working on is a CIO’s guide to
becoming UA compliant as we go through our lessons learned, we’re pulling
that together in the form of lessons and it will be a guidebook that eventually
will become part of the library of available resources for anybody who wants
to set down this journey.

Thank you, I think that’s the last slide for me.
Don Hollander:

Thanks very much. I’m just very conscious of the time. I’m not blaming
anybody but myself. But any quick questions? Edmon, you’re going to ask for
something for next time? Go ahead.

Edmon Chung:

Edmon here. So you – it’s great that for the update and also it’s great that
using the model of the five elements. I just want to get a sense of how well
they fit so far? You know, what we have produced from the UASG you may
have found additional things that need to be added to our documents and
stuff. And maybe some of them is not relevant at all. And so I just want to get
a sense of how accurate we have been so far. And, you know, because I
view this as an interactive process rather than, you know, produce something
and then put it – implementation down the road.

Ashwin Rangan: Thank you, Edmon. I think for me the area that needed the most work on our
own part was the fourth step in the five step process, which is the process
step. We found all kinds of oddities in a fairly small sample size. So I think we
theorized what may likely be needed to be done in processing. And I think as
we’re getting into the nitty-gritty of doing it, we’re hitting fairly interesting
corner cases. And we’re saying, now what? Now what do we do?
It’s very interesting to go through that process. And I think as we discover
more and as everybody discovers more, if we’re able to bring this – bring it all
back to this forum and we include that in the package that gets created by the
USAG, it’ll be helpful for everybody. I mean, there may be, I don’t know, we
have 9 or 10 different use cases that we’ve now written up in that one step.
The final library may be 20 use cases, I’m just speculating. But it’ll be helpful
to see it from different angles and say here are all the watch-outs and
gotchas so.
Don Hollander:

Thanks very much. One of the exercises that we have underway is reviewing
criteria for programming language evaluation and that’ll be quite valuable

input into that. So as I said, we’re – I’m just conscious of time and if we can
just carry on with the next slide. There’s – we want to finish when the big
hand’s on the 2. Thanks.
Next. Next. So I want to just talk a little bit about measurement and just
because of time we’re going to miss out on the browsers, but that’ll be – we’ll
send some material out through the UA discuss list. But as I said at the
beginning, we’re starting measurement based on browsers and Website
activity. Next slide please.
And this is our – after two quarters of detailed testing of the most popular
Websites in the world, this is where we built on the work from Donuts and
dotClub. And we found that for short TLDs, so these are four characters, we
got reasonably high results. If we went to a five character TLD, it’s not so
good. And then as you see, as you go further along the line, actually you
probably can’t see, but the least accepted one was our tie at tie.tie domain
names.
Next slide. Next. So we’re going to skip the browser review. Next. And I just
want to give you some idea as to where we’re at financially. So this is a one
page. We had a budget of about $770,000 available to us at the beginning of
this financial year. And we’re expecting, by the (unintelligible), which is next
week, we will have been underspent by over half a million dollars which is, I
guess, good. But also not so very good.
And part of that was some administrative constraints over the past three
months, and part of it was just figuring out what we’re going to do and how
we’re going to do it. And we were able to leverage volunteer resources to get
things done. So any questions about the current financial year? Christian?
Christian Dawson:

I just want to build on your comment about the reasoning behind the
budget. The fact is that when your goal is to put your arms around the whole
world and change the way it works you have to figure out how you are going

ICANN
Coordinator: Nathalie Peregrine

Confirmation #8995685
Page 34

to – where you’re going to start. And it takes – it took us longer to figure out
where we were going to start than many of us hoped and it took a couple of
organizational changes. Now we’ve got the right one and we’ve got the right
focus. So now is the time where it is reasonable for us to spend money.
Before it was unreasonable for us to spend money.
And so I look at that as oh maybe not so bad but as long as we can continue
to convince people that we’ve gotten to a point where it’s right to start firing
missiles I’m happy.
Ram Mohan:

Don, this is Ram. This is actually a pretty good example of the focus of UASG
and what we’re doing on behalf of the community. We’re focused not so
much on effort but we’re focused much more on effect. And if you think that
we don’t get enough effect then we’d rather withhold the effort until we are
ready. And that’s kind of the evidence of that approach. We’ll continue to be
in this mode. We’d rather not spend money that is in the budget than spend it
just because it is in the budget.

Don Hollander:

Thanks very much. So in terms of what we want to do next year, this has
been circulated to the UA discuss list but I’d like to go through it just a little bit
just to verbalize what we’re planning on doing. So next slide please. So next
slide.
So this is some of the work that we’re doing. So EAI is a big focus for us and
we’ve got about $130,000 principally to try to facilitate organization and
gatherings of EAI folk. Next slide please.
And if people have questions, Ram is paying attention to hands and will
interrupt. So the work that I talked about before about, you know, modifying
programing languages where had money in last year’s budget to do that so
we have even more money in this year’s budget and that’s planned to kick off
any time now.

So the plan is we’ve got these four groups, we’ll put them out to fix these
things and there will be a cooperative effort. Next slide please. This is our
monitoring and measuring activities. So we’re looking to fund somebody to go
and review Websites as we’ve done over the past six weeks. And we’ve been
doing it for most of this year but we just added some more resources towards
the end of the financial year.
We're going to look at automated evaluation so building on some of the work
that ICANN IT has done, see if we can provide people a tool that can go
through their application code and see where they have to look and whether
they have to look.
And one of the things that Tony raised was can we track complaints and then
do something about it. So we do have money in the budget for next year to
do that. Next slide please.
So community outreach is where we’re going to put a lot of focus. And these
are the activities that we’re looking to do. And you may or may not be able to
read that but this is – shouldn’t be new to too many people. We’ll develop
some case studies and we’ve already started that. We’ll monitor media and
produce quarterly reports and so forth. And next slide please.
And another part of the community outreach are UA ambassadors, which
we’ve talked about over the course of the past year and a bit, so this is to
provide some resources for them if that’s necessary. And then local initiatives
so we heard that there may be a need for local communities to get some
startup capital, for lack of a better term, I call it beer money, so to reach out to
your local IT development community. And if that’s that it takes then we can
make contribution. Next slide please.
So we planned for next year to have a Website so we’ve decided to do that,
accelerate that, and that is now in production as UASG.tech. Next slide. And

these are some administrative costs. That was very quick. I accept that. Any
questions?
Ram Mohan:

Any questions or comments?

(Radene):

Hi. It’s (Radene) from CentralNIC. I’m just wondering whether you’re applying
anything in the Middle Eastern region, any outreach or local community
efforts there?

Don Hollander:

Have you got good ideas?

(Radene):

Well, I could look at leaning on some of our clients…

Don Hollander:

Fantastic.

(Radene):

…because we work with some of the…

((Crosstalk))
Don Hollander:

So the answer is yes.

(Radene):

…groups there who have IDN TLDs. But they don’t really know – they need
guidance. So like I say, I mean, I’m quite happy to try and bridge the gap but I
don’t know if they would know how to tackle this issue.

Ram Mohan:

We’re absolutely delighted to hear that. And to engage with that. And this is
exactly the kind of thing that we need. So please do provide, you know, those
introductions. And please stay part of the conversation because your clients
trust you for the advice that you give them. And it’s actually important that we
don’t disintermediate you. So that will be part of our normal methodology is to
make sure that we provide materials, provide information, provide training as
well but, you know, ensure that the bridge remains. Thank you.

Tony Harris:

Just two quick points on what’s been said. First of all, about the budget, this
is a small budget. It’s okay for now but when this activity scales and really
becomes – it requires a lot of push, let’s put it that way, it will require probably
more funding. I’d just like to point out I’m involved in the drafting team for
what to do with the auction funds, which is a lot of money.
I mean, that money comes from people who pay for applications. It would
seem to make sense that a portion of that should be perhaps earmarked, I’m
not saying right now, but for the coming years, for the work that we have to
do, I mean, it’s being paid by people who are suffering the consequences of
universal acceptance. And the second point very quickly is I just looked at the
ICANN homepage and there’s absolutely no reference to universal
acceptance which is a shame.

Ram Mohan:

Thanks, Tony. Excellent comments. Let me get to the second one first. I think
we should temper our own expectations on what is going to be on the ICANN
page. I think ICANN itself is in the middle of revamping and thinking about
navigation and things like that. And what we’ve been doing from UASG is
make sure that our Website is up and we have all of our materials ready to go
before we start engaging with the ICANN media side and, you know, get
mentions there. So but that’s in the plans. We intend to work on that.
As far as the budget itself for the future years, what you’re saying may well be
true. We may need a much larger budget. It’s kind of – this year coming up is
going to be a pretty seminal year because we have no materials and we have
a plan of engagement and this is going to be our first year of kind of full scale
execution all year on. And so you may well be right that that – there might be
more funds needed.
My own approach is that the – there are two kind of sets of activities that
UASG is doing. One, the area that actually requires less money but a lot
more work is in the area of not – is the area of getting to the protocols and the

ICANN
Coordinator: Nathalie Peregrine

Confirmation #8995685
Page 38

technology and all of those things. There’s a lot of work there but the value
for money is pretty high and the ability to leverage money is very good there.
The place where there is a lot more money needed probably is going to be in
the outreach area because it’s a big world. And we have a large message to
send out.
Tony Harris:

Just one very – other quick point, I’m sorry, I don’t want to take up the mic all
the time. But the statement that was on Ashwin’s presentation right at the
beginning which defines what universal acceptance is, when all Websites
and, you know the statement I’m talking about. That would make a great
footnote for every communication that ICANN puts out.
I mean, we use footnotes in my association on everything we send out which
says what (Cabasa) is. Okay, so we send a letter, we send a newsletter, we
go to the press with any type of news, at the bottom we always have that
message.

Ram Mohan:

That’s a great idea. You know, we have this session being transcribed and
we’ll make sure to collect the actions out of it and come back and reflect that
and follow up on it. Thank you for that.

Don Hollander:

Right, so I think I just have a couple more slides if I have time? So this is a
Website launch, you guys have all seen it now. Next. And this is general
discussion. So just one other comment that I didn’t raise is for those of you
who are uber-geeks, and you know what IDNA 2003 theory and IDNA 2008
and Unicode mean and how they relate, so not always very well. So we’ve
got a little project that we’re going to fund to try to get both those groups to
cooperate.

Ram Mohan:

So, Don, perhaps I can take just a minute for that. In terms of context, some
of you may know that in the DNS side of the world, most registries, registrars,
etcetera, follow two protocols, this IDNA 2003 and IDNA 2008, they’re both

ICANN
Coordinator: Nathalie Peregrine

Confirmation #8995685
Page 39

RFCs from the IETF. Two thousand and eight effectively intended to replace
2003 although there are 2003 – IDNA 2003 instances out in production.
In the meanwhile and IDNA 2008 is kind of anchored in a particular version of
Unicode. And the reality is that as time has passed, Unicode has moved on.
And Unicode is now just put out Unicode-9. And if memory serves me right,
IDNA 2008 is anchored in Unicode-6. And so as time has moved on there
has been some divergence and there’s a need to find a way, if it possible, for
some level of harmonization.
It’s not certain whether that’s possible but the idea here is to perhaps build –
get an Internet draft out for the IETF community to go and look at what are
the issues and potentially generate some interest in bringing those who have
expertise in IDNs and bring that – bring a group together in the IETF to work
on a new – potentially a new version of the IDNA protocol that might actually
not be as anchored to an individual version of Unicode as the current version
does.
Don Hollander:

So with that and we now are spot on time for the next group to come in.
Thank you very much. Any questions we’ll be in the hallway or online. Thank
you.

Ashwin Rangan: Thank you, Ram.
