This is not the KSK Rollover
•

You may have recently heard about work underway to roll
the root zone Key Signing Key (aka Trust Anchor).

•

That’s not what this is.

•

Verisign is working closely with the other Root Zone
Management partners to ensure that the ZSK length
change does not coincide with other activity that would
increase the root zone DNSKEY response size.

The ZSK Rollover Process
•

ZSK is Rolled quarterly

•

Quarter is divided into 9 slots of 10 days each
•

Sometimes the 9th slot is longer

•

The DNSKEY RRSIG record changes in each slot

•

Uses pre-publish technique

•

•

Incoming ZSKs pre-published for one slot (9th slot)

•

Outgoing ZSKs post-published for one slot (1st slot)

Size of DNSKEY response message increased due to
pre-/post-publish

Size of Other Signed Responses
•

All non-DNSKEY RRSets are signed by the ZSK

•

DO=1 responses will be larger

•

1024-bit ZSK signature (RRSIG) : 159 octets

•

2048-bit ZSK signature (RRSIG) : 287 octets

•

But its not that simple....

•

We replayed real query logs to various DNSSEC
configurations to understand traffic impacts

Verisign Public

19

Measurement Methodology
•

Captured 10 minutes of queries sent to a.root-servers.net

•

Signed a root zone with various DNSSEC configurations

•

Replayed traffic over both UDP and TCP
•

•

Including client EDNS0 UDP message sizes and DO flag values

Recorded the response size, TC flag, etc.

Fallback Plan

Verisign Public

28

Need for Fallback
•

We fully expect the length change to occur without
incident

•

However, unforeseen problems may be beyond our
control

•

Should it be necessary, we are prepared to revert to a
“known good state”
•

•

i.e. a 1024-bit ZSK

In fact the exact same 1024-bit key just prior to the length
change

Verisign Public

29

Dual KSRs / SKRs
In support of this fallback plan, ICANN will sign two KSRs
at two root KSK ceremonies:
The 2048-bit ZSK

•
•

The fallback 1024-bit ZSK

•
•

Verisign Public

plus associated post-publish and pre-publish keys

plus associated post-publish and pre-publish keys

30

Fallback Criteria
•

Something unforeseen

•

Something very serious

•

Something that can not be solved by (temporarily)
disabling DNSSEC validation at a small number of
recursive name servers.

A “Slot 9” Fallback
If a problem arises during the slot 9 2048-bit pre-publish
phase:
•

Simply un-publish the 2048-bit ZSK from the root zone

•

Publish only the current 1024-bit ZSK

•

Continue signing with the current 1024-bit ZSK

•

There will be no ZSK roll for the next calendar quarter

A “Slot 1” Fallback
If a problem arises during slot 1 after signing with the 2048bit ZSK:
•

Revert to signing with the old 1024-bit ZSK
•

•

It is still being published

When to remove 2048-bit ZSK from zone depends on
nature and severity of problem
