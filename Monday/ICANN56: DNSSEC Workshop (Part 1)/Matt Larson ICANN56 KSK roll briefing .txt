DNSSEC in the Root Zone Managed Jointly
• ICANN	(IANA	Functions	Operator)
– Manages	the	KSK,	same	key	since	operations	began	in	
2010
– Quarterly	the	KSK	signs	the	ZSK	in	a	key	ceremony

• Verisign	(Root	Zone	Maintainer)
– Manages	the	ZSK,	key	changed	quarterly
– The	root	DNSKEY	RRset is	managed	in	10-day	“slots”

• In	coordination	with	US	DoC NTIA	per	agreements

| 2

Activities Underway
• ZSK	size	increasing
– Activity	managed	by	Verisign,	covered	elsewhere
– This	activity	will	happen	before...

• KSK	changing	(“rolling”)
• Separate	but	coordinated	activities

| 3

Why Change the KSK?
• Primary	reason:	operational	preparedness
–
–
–
–

KSK	has	no	expiration	date
Currently	no	weakness
But	no	key	should	live	forever:	bad	cryptographic	practice
Prefer	to	exercise	rollover	process	under	normal	conditions
• As	opposed	to	abnormal,	such	as	key	compromise

• Big	challenge
– Involves	countless/uncountable	participants
– No	test	environment	can	cover	all	possibilities

Planned KSK Roll Dates
• Plans	publically	available	mid-July,	2016
• Key	ceremonies
– Q4	2016	ceremony	(November):	generate	new	KSK
– Q1	2017	ceremony	(February):	KSK	operationally	ready

• DNS	changes
– New	KSK	in	root	zone	on	July	11,	2017
– New	KSK	signs	DNSKEY	RRset beginning	October	11,	2017
– Current	KSK	revoked	on	January	11,	2018
(Timing	contingent	on	successful	ZSK	size	increase)

If Issues Arise
• Plan	includes	back-out	capability
– If	necessary,	can	stay	in	current	state	or	roll	back	at	every	phase
• Until	old	key	revoked	 in	Q1	2018

– Multiple	back-out	DNSKEY	RRsets signed	at	each	ceremony
• Back	out	can	be	immediate
• No	need	for	extra	key	ceremony

• Extensive	monitoring	during	each	phase
– Near-real	time	analysis	of	root	server	traffic,	observation	of	
operational	mailing	lists	and	social	media,	etc.
– Criteria	for	triggering	back	out	under	development
– Will	not	be	absolute	but	allow	for	operational	discretion

| 7

Upcoming Activities
• Presenting	the	plan	(July	to	December	2016)
– Informal	feedback

• Presenting	the	new	KSK	(January	to	July	2017)
– New	key	will	be	introduced	and	publicized

• Follow	Automated	Updates (RFC	5011)
– July	11,	2017	through	early	2018

| 8

Changing Trust Anchors
• Trust	anchors	are	configured	data	in	DNSSEC	
validators
– If	Automated	Updates	of	DNSSEC	Trust	Anchors
(RFC	5011)	is	enabled	and	working,	the	roll	is	
automatic
– Otherwise	manual	intervention	required
• Add	the	new	KSK	before	October	11,	2017	(assuming	all	
is	on	track)
• Remove	the	old	KSK	at	a	later	date

| 9

Testing Resources
• Resources	targeted	for	software	developers
– Two	third-party	“accelerated”	RFC	5011	test	environments	
with	sped	up	clocks
• http://toot-servers.net
• http://keyroll.systems

• Resources	more	suitable	for	operators
– “Real	time”	RFC	5011	test	environment	being	developed	
by	ICANN
– Roll	a	test	zone	trust	anchor	with	actual	30-day	Add	HoldDown	timer
