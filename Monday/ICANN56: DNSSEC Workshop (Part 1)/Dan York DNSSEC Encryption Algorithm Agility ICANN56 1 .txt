DNSSEC Algorithms
•  Used to generate keys for signing
•  DNSKEY

•  Used in DNSSEC signatures
•  RRSIG

•  Used for DS record for chain of trust
•  DS

•  Used in validation of DNSSEC records

Elliptic Curve DNSSEC Algorithms
•  ECDSA – RFC 6605 – April 2012

Under development:
•  Ed25519:
•  draft-ietf-curdle-dnskey-ed25519

•  Ed448
•  draft-sury-dnskey-ed448

(See “New Curves in DNSSEC” from ICANN 55)
www.internetsociety.org/deploy360

Why Do We Care About Newer Algorithms?
•  Faster!
•  Signing
•  Validation

•  Smaller keys and signatures
•  Packet size (and avoiding fragmentation)
•  Minimizing potential reflection/DDoS attacks

•  Better cryptography
•  Move away from 1024-bit RSA

Aspects of Deploying New Algorithms
•  Validation
•  Signing / DNS Hosting Operators
•  Registries
•  Registrars
•  Developers

(See ICANN 55 Marrakech DNSSEC Workshop archives

What Have We Learned?

•  A conversation with Ondřej Surý

www.internetsociety.org/deploy360

Next Steps
•  Help people understand value and need to support
new algorithms
•  Document these steps in a form that can be
distributed (ex. Internet-draft)
•  ?

•  Need to start NOW as it will take several years to
deploy...
