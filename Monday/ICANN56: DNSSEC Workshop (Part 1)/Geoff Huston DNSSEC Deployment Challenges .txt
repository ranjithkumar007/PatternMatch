positive	step	in	cleaning	up	the	putrid	rotting	security	
fiasco	that	is	CA	certificates	today!

But maybe there is a point
here
• Is	having	resolvers	validate	what	they	provide	
back	to	the	query	agent	enough	to	improve	
the	security	of	the	DNS?
– If	you	can	intrude	in	an	open	conversation	
between	the	client	and	their	resolver	then	MITM	
attacks	in	the	DNS	can	still	take	place

How can we improve this
situation?
Some	potential	directions
– Push	validation	back	to	the	client	application
• Such	as	GetDNS

– Secure	the	conversation	between	the	application	
and	a	trusted	resolver
• Such	as	https://dns.google.com

– (re)introduce	DANE	to	browsers	using	DNSSEC	
credential	stapling

Is ever so slightly faster really better than vulnerability
to third party attack via compromised CAs?
