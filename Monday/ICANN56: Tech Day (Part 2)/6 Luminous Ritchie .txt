Secure	Domain	Foundation
• Non-profit
– Founded	in	2014

• Proactive	mitigation	of	malicious	domains	used	
for	cybercrime
– A	clearinghouse	for	intel	on	malicious	domains
• Malicious	domains	and	numbers
• Bad	Actor	indicators	(email,	IP,	name	servers,	addresses)

– A	forum	for	sharing	data,	intel	and	knowledge
• Trust	group
• Data,	Research,	Analysis,	Discussion

Some	Use	Cases
• Registrars	and	Hosts

– Does	this	account	owner	have	a	reputation	for	
malicious	activity?

• Registries

– What	domains	in	my	TLD	were	reported	as	malicious	
today?

• Security	Analysts

– What	other	domains	are	associated	with	this	{domain,	
email,	IP,	NS,	phone}

• Researchers	

– Statistics	for	policy	decisions	(empirical	data)

Proactive	Use	Case

What	can	we	infer	from	a	malicious	
indicator?
• Given	a:
– Domain	name
– IP	address
– Email	address

There	is	a	LOT	of	data
There	is	a	LOT	of	data	churn
Success	breeds	a	LOT	of	queries
Searches	need	to	be	fuzzy
Implementation	can	be	operationally	intensive

Introducing	Luminous
• A	large,	searchable	repository	of	parsed	whois
data	and	malicious	indicators
• Designed	for
– High	Performance	and	Reliability
– Scalability
– Low(er)	operational	needs
– Very	Flexible

• Query:	CLI,	API,	Web	interfaces
• Output:	XML,	JSON,	Text

Luminous	Data
• Whois since	July	2014
– 80M	gTLD records
– 120K-150K	new	registrations	per	day

• Historical	Whois
– 170M	gTLD records

• Indicators	of	malicious	activity
– 7M	unique	indicators
• 10K-100K	being	added	per	day
