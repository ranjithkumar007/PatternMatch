Things it musn’t do
• Create a class of registrars who don't use
EPP and our proprietary equivalent
• Allow one part of a registrar to work in an
uncoordinated way with another part
• Do things in private that we should do in
public
• Provide a new way to attack a domain
• Substantially increase support costs
So no functionality that duplicates EPP !

Recap
• Transaction data
Split into sections – each with specific aim
Gentle gamification

• Opportunities
Lists they can use to upsell, cross-sell, retain
No tracking, no pushing, up to them to use

• Quality
Bad WHOIS data – nightly text pattern matching
SRS/EPP errors – straight from system
Zone errors – from our weekly zone scan
Compromised / phishing sites – external feeds

Access controlled roles

• Access to more registrant data
2FA

• Industry categorisation
Using our machine learning tools

Possible future
• Probabilistic modelling of cancellations
Renewal intervention points

• Extend model to domain ‘value’
Historical lifetime value of domain names.
Projected value of recently acquired
domains/registrants (if we can build model)
Historical lifetime value of registrants

• Refine algorithm for detecting portfolios
Understand portfolio customers
Registrants with growing / falling portfolios
