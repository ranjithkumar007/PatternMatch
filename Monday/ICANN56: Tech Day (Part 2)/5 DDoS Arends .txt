RFC 1528-1529-1530
RFC 1569
RFC 1703
“Remote Printing”
The idea: send an email to a fax.
You’ll need a phone number, reverse it, look it up in DNS (type MX)

Lets talk about IP6.INT


1.


IPv6 Standards Action
In August 2001 the IETF published [RFC3152], which advised that the
use of "ip6.int" as the domain for reverse-mapping of IPv6 addresses
to DNS names was deprecated. The document noted that the use of
"ip6.int" would be phased out in an orderly fashion.







As of 1 September 2005, the IETF advises the community that the DNS
domain "ip6.int" should no longer be used to perform reverse mapping
of IPv6 addresses to domain names, and that the domain "ip6.arpa"
should be used henceforth, in accordance with the IANA Considerations
described in [RFC3596]. The domain "ip6.int" is deprecated, and its
use in IPv6 implementations that conform to the IPv6 Internet
Standards is discontinued.

Conclusion

• 

Legacy stuff never goes away
• 

Regardless if the domain is failing

• 

Regardless if the domain is non-existent

• 

[meme alert] The Internet Never Forgets

• 

A single botnet can easily overwhelm smaller TLD

• 

Analysing DNS traffic is fun!
