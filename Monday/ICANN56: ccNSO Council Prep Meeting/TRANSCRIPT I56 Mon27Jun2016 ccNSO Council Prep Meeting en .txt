HELSINKI – ccNSO Council Prep Meeting
Monday, June 27, 2016 – 10:45 to 12:00 EEST
ICANN56 | Helsinki, Finland

UNIDENTIFIED MALE:

Hello?

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:

[Sorry].

KATRINA SATAKI:

Hello. Has somebody just joined the conference call?
The ccNSO Council Preparatory Session is scheduled to start in
about 30 minutes from now.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE:

KATRINA SATAKI:

Dear councilors, we’re about to start. Please take your seats.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE:

Oh. I can [shout].
Good morning again. I think we can start. We still miss a couple
of councilors, but we have Ching on Adobe Bridge.

CHING CHIAO:

Good morning. [inaudible] everyone.

KATRINA SATAKI:

Good morning. Sorry you can’t be with us here, but we hope that
you will join us later this week.

CHING CHIAO:

Yes, very soon. I’m on the highway now.

KATRINA SATAKI:

That’s good. You got your folders with a draft agenda for our
meeting on Thursday. Any comments regarding the agenda?
Anything you'd like to add on this stage before we start
discussions? Because there are several points I’d like to stress.
Okay. Now while you start reading it, there are a couple of things
that we need to do this Thursday. First one is about the PDP. We
discussed it already the couple of our calls. We have appointed
the issue manager.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE:

This is the wrong one.

KATRINA SATAKI:

Yeah, that's the old one. We appointed the issue manager. One
thing that was left for you to think about while you were
traveling, it’s about the oversight committee. It’s a normal thing
that when we have a PDP, before we actually launch it, when we
work on this issue report, we have issue manager and have
oversight committee from the councilors. Have you had time to
give a thought to that, and does anyone would like to apply to
this oversight committee?

BECKY BURR:

[I have a question].

KATRINA SATAKI:

Becky, you'd like to say something?

BECKY BURR:

I think it’s a very good idea to have an oversight committee
while the issues report is being drafted. There is quite a lot of
collective wisdom in the group on these issues and where the
questions are, so unless others have a different view, I think it
would be useful to have an oversight committee.

KATRINA SATAKI:

Thank you. Nigel?

NIGEL ROBERTS:

I’ll leave my question [inaudible]. I’ve said I agree with what you
just said. The question is, how many councilors need to be on it?

KATRINA SATAKI:

That is a very good question. Bart, can you comment on that?

BART BOSWINKEL:

In principle, it’s [three]. It’s not part of the structure of [annex] B.
It’s one of the add-ons of the councils, which they can decide. I
think my advice would be one from every region to ensure
consultation with the regions and one NomCom-er, as well. It’s
probably the best way to engage the broader community.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE:

I think I agree with that. I think that adds up to six. Then we have
room for maneuver. We have a couple of spares in case
somebody is unavailable or ill or whatever.

KATRINA SATAKI:

Page 4 of 34

Thank you.

HELSINKI – ccNSO Council Prep Meeting

UNIDENTIFIED MALE:

EN

I don’t know. My advice also is – and you may have seen it in the
draft resolution that Becky sent yesterday – is at least Demi will
be on because he is the vice-Chair with the policy and policyrelated matters in his portfolio.

KATRINA SATAKI:

Demi, would you be available [for it]?

DEMI GETSCHKO:

Okay. No problems. It’s [inaudible].

KATRINA SATAKI:

Thank you. Demi is definitely there, so he will lead this oversight
committee. Again, we still have time until Thursday to think
about candidates. Regarding the timeline, as we already
discussed on our recent call, it would be great to have the issue
report ready by October so that we can present and discuss it in
Hyderabad.
Any other comments on that? Any suggestions, any thoughts?
You see I’m very diplomatic and democratic.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE:

[inaudible]

HELSINKI – ccNSO Council Prep Meeting

KATRINA SATAKI:

EN

If not, then another thing. Earlier in the week, I sent to you a
letter we received from the co-Chairs of the CCWG
Accountability. They are asking for our agreement on the draft
budget. Here we have another vice-Chair, who is more into all
those CCWG and CWG things and transitions and knows
everything. The boss there is Byron. I hope that you could give us
a short report on Thursday – not now, on Thursday – regarding
this budget.

BYRON HOLLAND:

And there is a plan to have a session with Mathieu on
Wednesday, at which point, there will be an opportunity to
become more informed as the whole community. Mathieu in
particular and I will be facilitating that discussion on
Wednesday.

KATRINA SATAKI:

Thank you very much. Another issue before we start talking
again about the Customer Standing Committee, there’s another
member we need to appoint. Here we’re talking about] our
member to RSSAC. As you know, RSSAC Charter is now out for a
public comment. We at the Guidelines Review Committee have
started working on the guideline for appointment of members to
the RSSAC. We have realized that actually, neither in proposal
nor in the charter, they have requirements for members on this

Page 6 of 34

HELSINKI – ccNSO Council Prep Meeting

EN

committee. Martin and I, we tried to reach out to Lisa and
Jonathan because probably they had something in mind when
they worked on the concept of this committee.
So far, we do not have a clear vision yet, but the guideline itself
will be a simplified version of the CSC guideline because this
time, we do not need to do any coordination with other
communities. We just select the person that fits the
requirements, whatever they might be.
The members of the Guidelines Review Committee also
proposed to have a clause saying that in case we do not find a
suitable candidate, the council may appoint one, just to choose
somebody and appoint. You will see that in the guideline.
Any other comments or questions about RSSAC? Yes, Bart?

BART BOSWINKEL:

If I understand it correctly, probably we’ll be more informed on
Tuesday. The community will be more informed on Tuesday. The
announcement will be very late, the ICANN announcement. My
understanding is they want to use the same type of procedure as
they were using for the CSC, but at the same time, the deadline
is still the 15th of August.

Page 7 of 34

HELSINKI – ccNSO Council Prep Meeting

KATRINA SATAKI:

EN

Yeah, actually we discussed it yesterday during the [inaudible].
One of the ways when we talk about requirements would be that
the ccNSO submits some comments to the charter and proposes
some requirements to be included in the charter. That’s one of
the ways, and if that's the case, probably we will need to submit
it [at] the council and do it really quickly after this meeting.
So far, the Guidelines Review Committee has dealt with CSC and
are currently dealing with RSSAC guidelines, but there will be
many other things that will still need to be in place by October.
Later today, we’ll have a meeting of the Guidelines Review
Committee where we try to understand what exactly needs to be
done. I think we would propose that we follow the same
approach we use for CSC and RSSAC guidelines, meaning that
we do not establish a new committee or a new working group to
work on new guidelines.
Again, we authorize the Guidelines Review Committee to come
up with the documents that are required. For that, we will need
to extend the mandate of the Guidelines Review Committee
because when we extended it last time, we were talking only
about CSC and RSSAC there. That’s another thing that we need
to discuss and agree on, on Thursday.
Another thing is, as you know, we have run this accountability
survey. Here, I will ask Joke to give a short update on the results.

Page 8 of 34

HELSINKI – ccNSO Council Prep Meeting

EN

As you know, the survey is closed. We closed it a couple of days
ago. We received I think 46 replies. So, Joke, can you please walk
us through?

JOKE BRAEKEN:

Yes, indeed. We received 46 replies. Most of them, as you can see
here from the first slide, came from the European region. The
questions we asked is, “Is your ccTLD a member of ccNSO? Yes
or no.” Most of them were indeed members. Then we asked for
their affiliation with regional organizations, so you will see that
in the chart regarding question number three.
“Which information do you use to stay informed about the
council? Where do you look for information about the activities
of the ccNSO council, and what would be your preferred method
to learn about the activities and the decisions of the ccNSO
council?” The preferred method by large majority was mailing
list.
“How well do you consider yourself to be informed about the
activities of the ccNSO council?” The responses were good. The
majority said that they consider themselves to be well informed,
as you can see here. Then there’s a slide that breaks down the
answer to this question per region.

Page 9 of 34

EN

HELSINKI – ccNSO Council Prep Meeting

“Does the ccNSO council welcome input from the community
and explain its decision and activities?” Indeed, most of the time
was the majority of the answers. Then regarding the review
mechanism, if respondents are familiar with this. This was an
open-ended

question,

and

any

further

comments

or

suggestions. Thank you.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:

Can you go back to [inaudible]?

KATRINA SATAKI:

Thank you, Joke. These are the results, 46 responses in not that
bad, but I would really love to see more responses, especially
from Africa – okay, North America, I think we cannot expect
much – and from Asia Pacific. My proposal is that we reach out
to regional organizations and ask them probably to facilitate
more responses, more feedback from their communities
because this is really important.
At this point, it looks okay. People are informed, they believe
that members vote is sufficient mechanism to redress ccNSO
council decisions, but it would be really interesting to see what
other ccTLDs think. Should we reopen it after the Helsinki
meeting, or you think this is enough for us to draw some
conclusions? Yes, Peter?

Page 10 of 34

HELSINKI – ccNSO Council Prep Meeting

PETER VERGOTE:

EN

Before answering that question, Katrina, I think we should
answer another question first. Is there something from the
current results that we can take with us? Is there some kind of a
follow up planned, and evaluation if there is something with the
current results that we can take home and further improve the
functions of the ccNSO, or is this not the case?
I think we should first answer that, and then decide whether we
are going to reopen or not the survey because the people that
took the effort in filling in right now, I think they deserve that we
have a thorough look at the kinds of messages that we wanted
to provide us. If we just reopen the survey and suppose that,
hopefully, we have a couple of dozen other ccTLDs that
responds, it might be that the two messages or the messages
that those two groups will feed to us get mingled.

KATRINA SATAKI:

Thank you, Peter. Nigel, you want [to say something]?

NIGEL ROBERTS:

I think it’s been very useful. This question that's on the screen in
particular is quite provocative of a very interesting debate. I
think when we talk about here redress of the ccNSO council
decision, it implies what we really need to be doing is actually

Page 11 of 34

HELSINKI – ccNSO Council Prep Meeting

EN

looking at going back to the bylaws with all this focus on
accountability and the actual structure of ICANN at the moment
and reminding ourselves and determining what the powers of
the ccNSO council actually are and what our purpose is.
There’s an implication in the question – it’s not exactly incorrect
either – that we as a council actually make decisions that affect
people, as if we’re a government making a decision to grant a
license or something when really the purpose of the council is
rather more conciliatory, declaratory in nature as far as the
bylaws are concerned. I think we need to get out of this idea of
the members send us to sit on here and make decisions, rather
than the coordination role that is really the main purpose of
being here.
I think it’s a great question. It’s a great survey. I’m not giving you
any answers or any prejudices here, but we should look at that.

KATRINA SATAKI:

Thank you. Bart.

BART BOSWINKEL:

[To] add to that, that's probably the important one because you
will not find this mechanism in the ICANN bylaws. This is an
internal rule of the ccNSO. That’s why we’ve included the link to
that rule mechanism. If you really start looking at it, and I think

Page 12 of 34

HELSINKI – ccNSO Council Prep Meeting

EN

it’s a great idea, but then consider the internal rules of the
ccNSO as part of that package because they threw one of the
articles. I don't know which one. You can see it in the new
guidelines. They all refer to the same section in the ICANN
bylaws. These are internal ccNSO rules.

KATRINA SATAKI:

Thank you. Any other comment? Yes, [inaudible].

UNIDENTIFIED MALE:

Thank you. Just a request. A significant number of ccTLDs in
Africa are francophone, which poses a major challenge when the
questionnaire is in English. If it could be considered in future,
then it will allow more participation, but it’s a major issue for us.

KATRINA SATAKI:

Thank you. That’s a good point. I must admit I’m totally unable
to translate it into French. Yeah?

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:

Maybe I can help. I speak French. Also, I wanted to add that
sometimes the e-mail doesn’t work, and for Haiti, there are
some internal issues and some of the e-mails don’t work. So it
can happen for other ccTLDs.

Page 13 of 34

HELSINKI – ccNSO Council Prep Meeting

KATRINA SATAKI:

EN

It’s always an issue. Of course, mails can get stuck in spam filters
and other technical things. In any case, I’m sure that we can
translate short surveys like that. Thanks for this proposal.
Probably it could improve participation in the future.
During our meeting days, we will have a session on
accountability and we’ll talk a little bit about this survey as well
because it gives us some initial basis to start a discussion and at
least some feeling on what the community thinks and how they
view the ccNSO and the council. Perhaps we will discuss it more
during the sessions if people would like to have it reopened or
not.
Thank you. If there are no more comments about this, next is a
hot topic. It’s about the CSC and selection of our members to the
Customer Standing Committee. Let me again stress the process.
I’ll tell you about the process step-by-step.
First, we inform the community about the CSC, and I think about
RSSAC as well during these two days. Then around Thursday, so
around June 30, we launch call of expression of interest. We give
time until 15 June, July sorry (it would be mean to have it until
15 June) 15 July to submit expression of interest.
When we have all the submissions, they submit them through
the secretariat e-mail. The secretariat sends all the applications
to all those councilors who did not submit their application, so

Page 14 of 34

HELSINKI – ccNSO Council Prep Meeting

EN

non-conflicting councilors. Councilors will have I don’t
remember how many days first to find out if they match the
criteria, if they fulfill the requirements, and then rank them. If we
have six, then up to five, and then five. If we have less, then how
many we have, and rank them in order of priority. Your top
candidate goes on top, second one second, third, and so on.
You send these results to a separate e-mail address. It will be
created specifically to deal with the rankings. It’s because emails that are sent to the secretariat are received by the Chair
and the vice-Chairs, just so that all of the votes are not visible to
everybody. They are just sent through a separate e-mail address.
The secretariat comes up with the total ranking, and the top two
candidates voted by all the non-conflicting councilors will be the
ones we choose to the Customer Standing Committee. Is it clear
so far? Good.
According to the proposal, we have to discuss our members with
the Registry Stakeholder Group. Here, that's why we proposed
and we agreed that we will have selection committee, which is
not a selection committee. It’s a coordination committee, but
we call it selection committee. We have this selection committee
just for organizational purposes, not to have this consultation
process too messy. We have six people from the council, and we
agreed on that. Six people from the council who will have a call

Page 15 of 34

HELSINKI – ccNSO Council Prep Meeting

EN

with Registry Stakeholder Group and inform about our members
and so on.
Then when we have this theoretical consultation with the
Registry Stakeholder Group, we will need to approve these two
selected members. We won’t have time for e-mail vote. It’s
around probably 21st July is the latest. Either we have call, and
we must be quorate in that case, or we just say, “You, selection
committee, have the right to approve these two members
selected by the council.” Are you with me so far? Good.
I know it’s very complicated, so I’m trying to make sure that we
are all on the same page. Now by 22nd of July, all the other
ACs/SOs, all those who will nominate their liaisons to the
Customer Standing Committee – again, there are five members
to the Customer Standing Committee. In this case, there would
be only four, two from registry stakeholders group and two from
ccNSO. Those can be ccNSO members and ccNSO non-members.
It really does not matter if those are members or not. All other
communities will have their candidates for liaison submitted.
According to the proposal and according to the CSC charter, at
this point, we the ccNSO council, we need to coordinate with the
GNSO to ensure that the final slate is diverse in terms of
geographic, gender, as diverse as possible because if no men
apply, then it’s going to be tricky to have them. Of course, it

Page 16 of 34

HELSINKI – ccNSO Council Prep Meeting

EN

would not be possible if we had only one liaison per SO/AC.
That’s why we kindly ask them to submit two names, two
diverse names, preferably. Not from the same region, for
example. If they’re going to submit their names for liaisons, that
would hopefully give us some leverage to choose a diverse slate
of members plus liaisons. They are not members. They are
liaisons.
Again, this must be done in consultation. To be more efficient,
again we think that it’s better if only six councilors or selection
committee will consult with designees from the GNSO about
which liaison to choose. There were, of course, some doubts
about that, so probably we should send all the names to all the
councilors so they can voice their concerns regarding some
individuals so we can try at least to choose another one, but
again, it’s diversity. It’s very difficult to play around with.
Here our selection committee, together with GNSO, will choose
liaisons to ensure there’s diversity.

CHING CHIAO:

Katrina, can I ask a simple question?

KATRINA SATAKI:

Yes, please, Ching.

Page 17 of 34

HELSINKI – ccNSO Council Prep Meeting

EN

CHING CHIAO:

Is it a good time just to clarify one…?

KATRINA SATAKI:

Absolutely, yes. Please ask.

CHING CHIAO:

Thanks. The question would be, let’s say we rank the top five
and we have the name of the [list]. We know the priority. Then
we talk to the GNSO. For example, there could be multiple
scenarios. For example, we insist that the top two ccNSO
candidates needs to be in the CSC. There’s no room for us to talk
with the GNSO. We must have these two people, or the scenario
is that the top two person that we pick after the consultation
with the GNSO, we gave up this first two and we only go for three
and four. The question would be whether it’s up to the selection
committee to do the job, or do we go back to the full council and
make the case and have those candidates to be selected.
This just kind of popped up in my head. It seems that this would
put the selection committee in a spot. Even if we put this very
bluntly, a bargaining process with GNSO in terms of the
diversity, in terms of the gender, this could put the selection
committee in a weird spot. I’m just throwing out this. Maybe

Page 18 of 34

HELSINKI – ccNSO Council Prep Meeting

EN

we’ll have more time to talk about this later during the members
meeting.

KATRINA SATAKI:

Thank you very much, Ching, for this question. No. The idea is
that these top two candidates that are selected as CSC members
from the ccNSO will remain the same. We’re playing around only
liaisons. Yes, Debbie.

DEBBIE MONAHAN:

I am all for diversity, and I believe that when you can get it, you
should have diversity, but I am first and foremost for the right
skills on that CSC. I think it’s really important. This has been set
up in the monitoring, and that of IANA is absolutely key. How it
starts will be very instrumental into how successful it is, so I’d
really urge that the top priority is the skills of those people. Then
if there are people with equivalent skills, then you can use
diversity as a way of perhaps differentiating between them, but
to me, the skill mix of those people is paramount.

KATRINA SATAKI:

Thank you for this comment. I totally agree with that and that
has been agreement on the Guidelines Review Committee, as
well. Yes, Bart?

Page 19 of 34

HELSINKI – ccNSO Council Prep Meeting

BART BOSWINKEL:

EN

If you look at the charter of the CSC, it’s in the CWG stewardship
proposal. It talks about to the extent possible, so first and
foremost, it’s the skill set and the experience. Then you start
looking at the diversity. To put it a little bit less diplomatic,
that's a nice thing to have diversity, but first and foremost is the
quality.

KATRINA SATAKI:

Yes, exactly. I totally agree with that. Since Bart started, I won’t
be diplomatic either.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE:

[When are you ever]?

KATRINA SATAKI:

That’s true, yes. I’m trying. I’m struggling, you see.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE:

Now you can [be your] actual self.

KATRINA SATAKI:

Yes, exactly. Now I can stop pretending.

Page 20 of 34

HELSINKI – ccNSO Council Prep Meeting

EN

We select members, and members are the ones who vote on the
CSC. Liaisons do not have the voting rights, so they are there for
beauty. Beauty contest. Here around this table – around would
probably not be the right word here – but we are a really diverse
group of people. We represent all five regions. We represent
bigger and smaller registries. We represent government and not
government, whatever. We’re really a diverse group of people,
and if we as a diverse group of people come up with two names,
you cannot apply diversity over diversity again. We come up with
two names that we believe are the best, and therefore, at least I
do not see any justifiable transparent algorithm. How can we
select the fifth on the ranking just because this person is a man,
for example?
We select two people, and we as a council, as a diverse group of
people, we select two names. These are the two names we stick
to.
After we have selected these two names to be members, to
represent the interests of ccTLDs on the Customer Standing
Committee, then we can do some beauty contest with liaisons.
Yes, I haven’t been diplomatic, but I hope that other
communities will select the best people from different regions
and different skillsets. Yes, totally agree. For us, the professional
criteria are much more important.

Page 21 of 34

HELSINKI – ccNSO Council Prep Meeting

EN

So far, we are in agreement. Now, when we have this selection
committee together with the GNSO, we have selected hopefully
to the extent possible diverse Customer Standing Committee.
Now again, according to all the documents, the ccNSO council
and the GNSO council have to adopt the full slate, which means
again either we as the council have a call – and I have no idea
how long it might take for the selection committee to coordinate
this beauty contest with the GNSO – but at some point, either we
have a call, we might not have a week to do vote over e-mail so
most probably we’ll have to have a call and we must be quorate.
It’s end of July, beginning of August – or again, we can authorize
the selection committee to vote on the beauty contest
Those two members selected by the ccNSO council won’t be
touched. We’re talking about the full slate. Any questions? Is it
clear? I know how complicated it is. It took us several months to
decipher it. Any questions? Peter?

PETER VERGOTE:

Not a question, but maybe a practical point in getting us further.
During the last ccNSO council call, I remember that I was more in
favor of having the full ccNSO council having the decision and
the vote on this, but the fair point was raised that we needed to
be quorate.

Page 22 of 34

HELSINKI – ccNSO Council Prep Meeting

EN

Would it be feasible that we set a limited number of dates upon
which a call could take place and then have the councilors look
at those potential dates and indicate whether they’re still
available during that days so we have a view whether there is
likely to be a problem with getting the quorum or not? If we see
that there is a risk, even only limited and let’s say only affecting
one particular region, if we get the feeling that we might run into
problems, it will probably be easier to accept that we say, “It’s
up to the selection committee to handle this.”

KATRINA SATAKI:

Yes, Nigel?

NIGEL ROBERTS:

Without going into detail for reasons I mentioned on the last call
and it may apply to others, we may have a slightly lesser pool of
people in order to make the quorum. You need to bear that in
mind, particularly with the quorum requirement that there be
one representative from each region.

KATRINA SATAKI:

Page 23 of 34

Thank you. Bart?

HELSINKI – ccNSO Council Prep Meeting

BART BOSWINKEL:

EN

Just to [allude, say you need to exclude] if a councilor’s [down],
you need to exclude him from that vote anyway.

KATRINA SATAKI:

Yes, Debbie?

DEBBIE MONAHAN:

I like Peter’s idea because if a councilor thought they were going
to be in that position, they’d just put unavailable, unavailable,
unavailable for all the calls. As long as that's done, with
something like a Doodle poll or something like that, you can
actually see at a glance. It’s easy enough for anyone in those
positions to just make themselves unavailable.

NIGEL ROBERTS:

I think that's a great suggestion. I wasn’t really referring to that. I
was referring to the fact that for example, say there was one
councilor in one region. The other two have got to make sure
one of them is on the call.

KATRINA SATAKI:

Page 24 of 34

Yeah, that's the case. Yes, Bart?

HELSINKI – ccNSO Council Prep Meeting

BART BOSWINKEL:

EN

Following your suggestion, I think that makes everybody’s life
easier. We all send out a Doodle poll later today, and if you can
respond by Wednesday, then we can inform council on Thursday
what the result is. Then you know where you're heading.

KATRINA SATAKI:

Yes, we can certainly do that. Thank you, Peter, for the
suggestion. Anyway, I’d like to have some backup plan if people
indicate that they are going to be on the call and if on that call,
we do not have quorum. We need to have a backup plan. Yes,
Stephen?

STEPHEN DEERHAKE:

Both of these calls are critically important. I’m assuming that
this Doodle poll will cover both calls.

KATRINA SATAKI:

It should, yes, both calls. The first is the 21st July. The secretariat
may ask you to work out, but again, we have no clue how this
will go, what it means to coordinate the pool of liaisons, how
much time it might take, and so on. It’s really a very dark forest
at this moment.

Associated with this, I will send out an e-mail this afternoon as
well, first of all regarding the PDP for the oversight committee. If
you form one from every region with the exception of Latin
America because we’ve got Demi, and for the other ones, and
secondly for the selection committee. If you want to put your
name forward, please let us know so we can appoint them by
Thursday.

KATRINA SATAKI:

Yes. These are two things that we need to have in place on
Thursday. Thank you. Any more questions, any comments
around that? If no, I think we have covered most of the issues
about our agenda for Thursday.
Then you have in your files a summary of the most important
sessions for these upcoming days. As you know, this is the first
time ever that we have this Meeting B or Policy Forum, and the
main idea is to break the silos. We work in silos until 3:00 PM,
and then after that, we go out into the wild and mingle with the
other communities. At least, that's the idea.
I must say, the program working group worked really hard
because things changed all the times and all the discussions
around cross-community sessions were a very hot debate, but
thanks to their hard work, I think we still have a very interesting
agenda.

But there are some things. You know that normally when we
have these sessions, we assign people. We ask who is going to go
to that session, and then somebody steps forward. Then we
write down that person A was going to session B. Then we ask
people to send the report to tell more about the particular
session.
Last time, we did receive three or two reports. Thanks to Peter,
thanks to Debbie and Giovanni. Somebody else I think
submitted the report, but generally people are not very active in
submitting their reports. The question is either we stop
assigning people to sessions or we give the secretariat a stick
they could use to chase those who agreed to report on the
session.
It sounds like Ching fainted there. What are your thoughts, dear
councilors? Do we keep assigning people to sessions and then
we ask the secretariat to chase them to get some feedback, or
we just go wherever we want and save some time for the
secretariat to do other things?

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:

Question?

KATRINA SATAKI:

Yes, Nigel?

Assuming we can remember back to when these were being
done a bit more diligently than they are now, what value did we
get from them, the reports?

BART BOSWINKEL:

They never [inaudible]

NIGEL ROBERTS:

I think you’ve answered the question then, haven’t you, Bart?

UNIDENTIFIED MALE:

[inaudible] certain [inaudible]

KATRINA SATAKI:

Theoretically, if a report is submitted, then other councilors can
read it. If there is no wish to ever read them, there’s no point in
asking anyone to write and submit them.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE:

Katrina, with respect, if we never get them to read, how do we
know people really want [it]?

Maybe this has evolved over time. Fortunately, we don’t need it
this time because of the agenda topics with the meeting with the
GAC, but these meetings were used and have always been used
to prep for the joint meetings. [And then add on] came at the
request of some of the councilors, came on an overview with
other interesting sessions are around. Say that part never got,
never off the ground. We don’t mind providing this overview, but
again, if you use it for your information, that's fine, as well. But
assigning people to it, it takes 10, 15 minutes. It’s awkward, and
we don’t follow up.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE:

I think assign [inaudible].

KATRINA SATAKI:

Anybody wants to write report?

UNIDENTIFIED MALE:

[inaudible]

KATRINA SATAKI:

Apparently no? Which means that we won’t assign people, but
still, if you go to a session and you spot something interesting
and see interesting developments there, please report back to
the council, just to alert others, as well.

May I ask a question? Do you find this helpful to go to sessions
and to find your way through the sessions? If you don’t use this
at all, then we stop preparing it. It’s good? It’s helpful? Okay,
then we’ll keep on preparing this.

KATRINA SATAKI:

Thank you for preparing this. I think it’s really interesting.
Actually, we have many interesting sessions, especially those
cross-community discussions that we have worked on. I’m sure
that they will be interesting. Any questions? Maybe Bart, you
could give a short overview of this, or it’s just self-explanatory.

BART BOSWINKEL:

I think it’s self-explanatory. The only thing is – and that may be
interesting for most of you who are not on the SOP, and it’s got a
little bit under the water. It’s on Tuesday afternoon, the session
at 5:00 with Sally Costerton and Susanna Bennett. It’s a crosscommunity session, and it’s on the operational planning goals of
some of the department KPIs, etc. It’s really a pre-empting on
future discussions on the direction of ICANN’s operation. That
might be an interesting one for those who are not very familiar
with the work of the SOP. I think that's the only one I really
wanted to stress for this week. The rest is self-explanatory.

KATRINA SATAKI:

Yes, Becky?

BECKY BURR:

This is probably not as useful for ccTLDs, but I would say that I
think that WHOIS issues are becoming increasingly complicated
and complex in ICANN, in part because with the new gTLDs,
we’re seeing a lot of gTLDs that are located in countries that
have more developed data protection regimes. It would be great
if CCs could share their experiences with WHOIS and what the
different arrangements are, to add that to the knowledge mix
and the discussions that are happening because I do think that it
generally is going to get to be a very complicated issue here.

KATRINA SATAKI:

Thank you, Becky. Any other comment?
If not, then there’s one more thing I wanted to say. It actually
came as a result of our prep meeting in Marrakech. If you
remember, we were thinking about some signs how to make
ccNSO people more recognizable. This is the outcome. You see?
Ribbon, ccNSO ribbon. You’ll get one.

You’ll get it tomorrow in your pack, so thanks a lot for this idea.
Margarita, I think it was yours.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE:

We used to do this years ago.

KATRINA SATAKI:

Really? Now we do it again. Please use it. Yes, Stephen?

STEVEN DEERHAKE:

I just want to make the Chair aware that we do not have a liaison
at this meeting for the ALAC.

KATRINA SATAKI:

Oh yeah, right. Any update on…? Yeah, please.

STEVEN DEERHAKE:

Our ALAC liaison, Ron Sherwood, has been in hospital this last
week. He obviously will not be at the meeting. It’s looking better
than it has been looking. I’ve been getting updates daily from his
wife, but he obviously will not be attending, and it’s very
doubtful he’ll be on Adobe chat either. We are down a liaison.

KATRINA SATAKI:

Thank you very much because we’ll miss him this meeting, but
we’re looking forward to see him in Hyderabad.

India.

In India, yes. I can make that. Thank you very much, and see you
tomorrow, definitely at the ccNSO cocktail.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE:

KATRINA SATAKI:

I will. Wednesday, and of course, Thursday when we have our
council meeting. Thank you very much, and don’t forget on
Wednesday evening, we have this invitation to the GNSO council
meeting. Drinks, drinks. Quarter past 7:00, yes.
