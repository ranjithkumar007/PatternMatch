What is policy for Numbers Community and
how it is developed?
Filiz Yilmaz, ASO AC Vice Chair, RIPE Representative to the AC

Who is this Numbers Community?

Regional Policy Development
Allocation of Internet Protocol and Autonomous System Numbers and registration
Stems from regional specific needs, grass-root practices

Based on shared Principles

Community discussions and decision-making processes are open for everyone
to participate
All community processes are transparent
All community processes are driven in a bottom-up fashion, meaning that
policy changes are the result of concerns or initiatives from members of the
community
Decision making is based on rough consensus

So then what are Global Policies?

https://aso.icann.org/global-policies/global-policies-2/

Who is ASO Address Council
15 people from 5 regions: 3 selected members from each region
https://aso.icann.org/advisory-council/address-council-members/
Coordination of the global policy development process
Selection of individuals to serve on ICANN Board seats 9 and 10
Advice to the ICANN Board on number resource allocation policy, in conjunction
with the RIRs.

Thank you.

IPv4 Exhaustion
AFRINIC is now the only one of the five RIRs that can still
allocate IPv4 address space according to traditional
policies.
• 1.7 /8s remaining in AFRINIC’s IPv4 inventory.
• “Soft landing” policy will take effect when only 1 /8 remains.
• Focus on getting IPv6 deployed throughout the region:




Free training on IPv6 Deployment: www.learn.afrinic.net.
Use of IPv6 test bed.
Knowledge share and information exchange.

Alan Barrett | AFRINIC

Policy Update 1
AFPUB-2015-GEN-001-DRAFT-01: Number Resources Transfer
Policy.

This proposal calls for IPv4 address transfers to be
facilitated in the AFRINIC region so that African network
operators can benefit from an open IPv4 address market
when AFRINIC’s IPv4 inventory is finally exhausted.
• Discussions during AFRINIC (23 & 24) included:


The feeling that the proposal stands to benefit regions other than
Africa.

• Status: Under Discussion.
Alan Barrett | AFRINIC

6

Policy Update 2
Two competing proposals to change IPv4 “Soft Landing” policy.
Current policy is AFPUB-2010-v4-005:

AFPUB-2016-V4-001-DRAFT-02: IPv4 Soft Landing BIS.

AFPUB-2016-V4-002-DRAFT01: Soft Landing Overhaul.

Alan Barrett | AFRINIC

7

Policy Update 3
AFPUB-2016-V4-001-DRAFT-02: IPv4 Soft Landing BIS.

• This proposal is an update to the current IPv4 Soft
Landing Policy and describes how AFRINIC will manage
allocations/assignments from the last IANA allocated /8
by defining two distinct exhaustion phases:





Phase 1: When only 1 /8 remains: Sets the maximum
allocation/assignment at a /15 instead of a /10.
Phase 2: When only 1 /10 remains: Sets the maximum to a /22
and the minimum to a /24.
Allocation period changes to 8 months.
Reserves a /16 for critical Internet infrastructure and a /13 for
unforeseen circumstances.

• Status: Under Discussion.
Alan Barrett | AFRINIC

8

Policy Update 4
AFPUB-2016-V4-002-DRAFT01: Soft Landing Overhaul.
• This proposal completely replaces the original and
current IPv4 Soft Landing Policy, AFPUB-2010-v4-005.
• New proposal:





Abolishes existing Soft Landing policy.
Intends to create a new category of resource requestors called
"new entrants”.
Proposes setting aside a /13 IPv4 block reserved for these "new
entrants”.
"New entrants" will get no more than a /22 of IPv4 space each.

• Status: Under Discussion.
Alan Barrett | AFRINIC

9

Policy Update 5
AFPUB-2016-GEN-001-DRAFT01: Internet Number
Resources Audit.
• Proposal authorizes AFRINIC to do regular audits of
resource utilisation in order to allow recovery of any type
of resource where usage is not in compliance with RSA.




Audits are based on compliance with terms outlined in RSA and
Allocation/Assignment Policies.
All resource types are affected by audits, not just IPv4.
Audits can be “random”, “selected” (where audit is triggered by
an internal non-compliance issue), or “reported” (say by a
whistle-blower).

• Status: Under Discussion.
Alan Barrett | AFRINIC

10

Policy Update 6
AFPUB-2016-v4-003-DRAFT01: Ipv4 Resource Transfers
within the AFRINIC region
• Proposal caters to those needing IPv4 space after
exhaustion of IPv4 pool, or when IPv4 needs of such
requester can no longer be satisfied by AFRINIC.





Both source and recipient must be AFRINIC members.
Source org not eligible to subsequent v4 block for a period of 12
months after a transfer.
Source must not have received a v4 transfer, allocation, or
assignment 12 months prior to approval of a transfer request.
Recipient must justify the need for the space.

• Status: Under Discussion.
Alan Barrett | AFRINIC

11

Policy Update 7
AFPUB-2016-GEN-002-DRAFT01: Inbound Transfer Policy
• Proposal caters to inbound transfer of all IP resources,
including ASN, IPv4 space and IPv6 space from other
RIRs to AFRINIC.



Recipient of v4 or v6 must provide a plan to AfriNIC for the use
of ~ 50% of the transferred resource within the next 5 years..
Space received via transfers shall be included in any evaluation
done for further resource allocation by AFRINIC.

• Status: Under Discussion.

Recent Developments from the ARIN Region
Two main topics of discussion in the ARIN region
●
●

Justified need vs open market
Policy simplification

Justified Need Over Open Market: Various Arguments
●

The RIRs provide a stewardship role
○
○
○

●
●

Internet numbers are a shared resource
Internet number resources should be conserved, and used efficiently
Internet number resources should be equally available to those who need them

Internet number resources have always been given out fairly on a justified
needs basis
Now that the ARIN free pool is depleted
○
○
○

Resources are scarce
Stewardship is more critical than it has ever been
An open market would concentrate IP addresses
■ The companies with the deepest pockets
■ The services that generate the most revenue per IP address
■

Competition for a given service in a given market could be stifled if one player has more
IPv4 addresses than the rest and wide spread IPv6 adoption has not occurred

Open Market Over Justified Need: Various Arguments
●

●
●

An open market will most efficiently distribute IP addresses
○
○

Only those who need IP addresses will pay for them
Supply / demand will set the price appropriately

○

Internet number resources will continue to be available for those who are willing to pay the
market rate

It is not possible to corner the market or manipulate pricing for gain
Justified need only makes sense when ARIN was giving out addresses
○

●

People are completing transfers outside of ARIN policy
○
○
○

●

ARIN free pool is empty, ARIN allocations / assignments are virtually done
IP futures
IP leases
IP transfer not recognized by ARIN

ARIN provides value in ensuring uniqueness and an accurate registry
○

Removal of justified need will allow whois to be accurate

Policy Simplification
●

Separation of transfer policy from ARIN allocation / assignment policy
○

●

Simplify transfer policy
○
○
○

●

Transfer policy references ARIN allocation / assignment policy rules
Make the process easier to understand and navigate
Make the process more predictable
Loosen / remove justified need

Remove ARIN allocation / assignment policy
○
○

ARIN is virtually no longer provide IPv4 addresses
Remove all the ARIN allocation and assignment policy

ARIN Policy Developments
Current policies under development
https://www.arin.net/policy/proposals/
ARIN 37 policy report
https://www.arin.net/vault/participate/meetings/reports/ARIN_37/ppm.html

Current ARIN Recommended Draft Policies
●

ARIN-2015-2: Modify 8.4 (Inter-RIR Transfers to Specified Recipients)
○

●

Allow transfers with no restriction to hold addresses for one year if the source and receiving
companies are under common control or one controls the other

ARIN-2016-1: Reserved Pool Transfer Policy
○

IP addresses from reserved pools are not permitted to be transferred

Current ARIN Draft Policies
●

ARIN-2015-7: Simplified requirements for demonstrated need for IPv4
transfers
○
○

●

ARIN-2016-2: Change timeframes for IPv4 requests to 24 months
○

●

Show 80% utilization of current holdings then double (up to a /12) for transfers

ARIN-2016-4: Transfers for new entrants
○
○

●

Re-align time horizon for ARIN allocation / assignments to match transfer time horizon

ARIN-2016-3: Alternative simplified criteria for justifying small IPv4 transfers
○

●

Split ARIN allocation / assignment policy from transfer policy
Show a plan for 50% utilization of current + requested resources within 2 years for transfers

ISP with no IPs can get up to a /21 transfer
End-users with no IPs can get a /24 transfer

ARIN-2016-5: Post-IPv4-Free-Pool-Depletion Transfer Policy
○
○
○
○

No utilization requirements for M&A transfers
Show 50% utilization of current holdings for transfers
Show a plan to use 50% of requested transfer within 2 years
Organization with no IPv4 addresses can get a /24 transfer

Recent ARIN Policy Developments (Pending Implementation)
●
●

ARIN-2015-3: Remove 30 day utilization requirement in end-user IPv4 policy
○ Remove 25% utilization in 30 days for end-users
ARIN-2015-5: Out of region use
○

ARIN resources can be used outside the ARIN service region
■ Requires a substantial connection to the region
●

■

●

ARIN-2015-11: Remove transfer language which only applied pre-exhaustion
○

●

Conducts business / has customers / has staff / holds meetings / has investors in
the ARIN service region
Requires a minimum used in region
● /22 IPv4, /44 IPv6, 1 ASN

Remove requirement that a source entity cannot receive ARIN allocation or assignment for
one year after being a source of a transfer

Editorial Change for M&A Transfers
○

Clarify that return of underutilized address space that is voluntary

Recent developments from LACNIC region

Ricardo Patara
ASO/AC from LACNIC region

Policy Development process

Policy discussions take place in the mailing list
(open and public)
Any proposal presented in the mailing list 4
weeks befor public forum are considered for
discussion in the forum
LACNIC holds 2 Policy Public Forum per year
● Next one to be holden in San José/CR Sept
26 to 30

Recent discussions

Very much focused in IPv6 and IPv4 transfers
and "termination phase"
Showing mature IPv6 deployment in the region
Concerns with IPv4 depletion
● LACNIC free pool ended Jul 2014
● Termination policies in place since then
○ 2 reserved IPv4 pools
■ /22 each 6 months
■ /22 for new members only

Recent approved policies

LAC-2016-6 Remove maximum size for IPv6
assignments to end users, which is currently
set to /32.
LAC-2016-4 Remove some of the
documentation requirements in order to justify
initial IPv6 allocation, like for instance detailed
routing plan and subnet planning.

Proposals in discussion

LAC-2016-5 For IPv6 allocations to have
additional organization category which would
be governamental ISP. As per author view,
currently they could not justify larger allocation.
LAC-2016-3 To remove multi-homed
verification when of initial allocation to ISPs.
Regions with fewer or just one option for
upstream provider would block ISPs to apply
for the initial allocation.

Proposals in discussion

LAC-2016-2 To create a new and exclusive
IPv4 for termination phase for Critical
infrastructure operators.

Other topics

IPv4 reserved pool had it size incremented
from original /11 to /10 ( new /11 added).
This due to the large amount of recovered IPv4
being received.
IPv4 intra-RIR transfer implemented last
March. Policy was already in the text but
inactive.
Also related to this, there was a policy proposal
to limit the period a new IPv4 allocation could
be then transferred to 3 years.

Thank you.
