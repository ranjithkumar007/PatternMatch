RSSAC Overview
Tripti Sinha

What is RSSAC?
• The role of the Root Server System Advisory
Committee ("RSSAC") is to advise the ICANN
community and Board on matters relating to
the operation, administration, security, and
integrity of the Internet's Root Server
System.
• (This is a very narrow scope!)

| 4

RSSAC organization
• RSSAC
– Appointed representatives from the 12 root
server operators
– Alternates to these
– Liaisons

• RSSAC Caucus
– Body of volunteer subject matter experts
– Appointed by RSSAC
| 5

Caucus
• Members

– 74 Technical Experts (47% not from Root Server
Operators)
– Public statements of interest
– Public credit for individual work

• Purpose

– Pool of experts who produce documents
• Expertise, critical mass, broad spectrum

– Transparency of who does the work
• Who, what expertise, which other hats

– Framework for getting work done
• Results, leaders, deadlines

• To apply, email rssac-membership@icann.org

of the Root Server System
Duane Wessels

RSSAC002v3: Measurements of the Root System v3
•

Helps meet the requirements of RSSAC001
(Advisory on Service Expectations of Root
Server Operators)

•

Provides valuable data regarding the
ongoing expansion of the root zone

•

Updated RSSAC002v2 based on
implementation experience

•

Added clarifications to document scope

•

Latency in publishing available data
Size of the overall root zone
Volume of traffic
Query and response size distribution
RCODE distribution

RSSAC002v3: Measurements of the Root System v3
Changes from RSSAC002v2:
Latency calculation changed to 95th percentile
Zone size only reported by Root Zone Maintainer
Clarify reasons for responses in traffic volume
Response metrics include only responses from
server
• Version number added to YAML for future proofing
• A naming scheme added to allow operators to
create their own metrics

RSSAC Workshop 2 Report
Brad Verd

RSSAC Workshop 2
• RSSAC conducted its second workshop in
May 2016.
• Purpose of the Workshop was to continue
addressing issues initiated in Workshop 1.
• A Workshop Planning Committee developed
statements ahead of time to prompt the
discussions.

| 16

RSSAC Workshop 2 – Statements
•

Architecture
•

Reliability and Robustness

•

DNS Root Service Performance and Availability

•

Root Server Operator Expectations

•

Evolution

•

Reinventing RSSAC

| 17

RSSAC Workshop 2 – Architecture
•

Reliability and Robustness
•

The DNS root service has consistently
offered a reliable and robust service.
Failure of any single operator poses no
threat to the system.

•

A work party was formed to document the
architectural and service robustness of the
root server system

| 18

RSSAC Workshop 2 – Architecture
•

DNS Root Service Performance and
Availability
•

Discussion concerning the technical risks
and benefits of adding or removing
authoritative name servers to the root
zone.

•

Consensus reached that there is no
technical need for more Root Zone
authoritative name servers.
| 19

RSSAC Workshop 2 – Architecture
•

Root Server Operator Expectations
•

Discussion concerning the commitment of
the 12 DNS root server operators.

•

RSSAC will issue a statement that will be
released to the community reflecting the
commitments of the root server operators.

| 20

RSSAC Workshop 2 – Evolution

Evolution:
•

Focused on technical metrics that define the
expectations for operating a root server.

•

A work party was formed from the RSSAC to
draft a document that will define the
technical requirements against	which	
potential	root	operators	could	be	evaluated.	

| 21

RSSAC Workshop 2 – Reinventing RSSAC

Reinventing RSSAC:
•

Focused on questions concerning the
communications role of RSSAC in root server
operations.

•

RSSAC took action to be the front door to
global DNS root service, and to the RSOs.

Updates on Current RSSAC Work
Tripti Sinha

History of Root Server System
In collaboration with root server operators, the RSSAC
has produced a report to inform the community on
the current root server system, and its history from
beginnings to present day. The report:
1. contains a chronological history of the root server
system from its origin to its current structure,
divided into historical periods.
2. contains a description the current operators, and
their histories in operating the root service,
provided by each operator organization.
| 24

Root Server System Naming Scheme
On 9 July 2015, the RSSAC established a Caucus work party to
produce “History and Technical Analysis of the Naming Scheme
Used for Individual Root Servers” with the following scope to:
1. Document the technical history of the names assigned to
individual root servers;
2. Consider changes to the current naming scheme, in particular
whether the names assigned to individual root servers should be
moved into the root zone from the root-servers.net zone;
3. Consider the impact on the priming response of including
DNSSEC signatures over root server address records;
4. Perform a risk analysis; and
5. Make a recommendation to root server operators, root zone
management partners, and ICANN on whether changes should be
made, and what those changes should be.
